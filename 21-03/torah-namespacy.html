in the beginning elohim-towards-these created the namespaces and the earth.and the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face-turns of the deep. and breath-spirit of elohim-towards-these moved upon the face-turns of the from-waters.and elohim-towards-these said, let there be light: and there was light.and elohim-towards-these saw the light, that it was good: and elohim-towards-these divided the light from the darkness.and elohim-towards-these called the light day, and the darkness he called night. and the evening and the morning were the first day.and elohim-towards-these said, let there be a firmament in the midst of the from-waters, and let it divide the from-waters from the from-waters.and elohim-towards-these made the firmament, and divided the from-waters which were under the firmament from the from-waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.and elohim-towards-these called the firmament namespaces. and the evening and the morning were the second day.and elohim-towards-these said, let the from-waters under the namespaces be added together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.and elohim-towards-these called the dry land earth; and the gathering together of the from-waters called he seas: and elohim-towards-these saw that it was good.and elohim-towards-these said, let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.and the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and elohim-towards-these saw that it was good.and the evening and the morning were the third day.and elohim-towards-these said, let there be lights in the firmament of the namespaces to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:and let them be for lights in the firmament of the namespaces to give light upon the earth: and it was so.and elohim-towards-these made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.and elohim-towards-these set them in the firmament of the namespaces to give light upon the earth,and to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and elohim-towards-these saw that it was good.and the evening and the morning were the fourth day.and elohim-towards-these said, let the from-waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of namespaces.and elohim-towards-these created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the from-waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and elohim-towards-these saw that it was good.and elohim-towards-these knee-fluffy-blessed them, saying, be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the from-waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.and the evening and the morning were the fifth day.and elohim-towards-these said, let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, in-them-animal, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.and elohim-towards-these made the beast of the earth after his kind, and in-them-animal after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and elohim-towards-these saw that it was good.and elohim-towards-these said, let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the in-them-animal, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.so elohim-towards-these created man in his own image, in the image of elohim-towards-these created he him; rememberer and pierced created he them.and elohim-towards-these knee-fluffy-blessed them, and elohim-towards-these said unto them, be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the earth, and shepherd-preserve it: and go down on over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.and elohim-towards-these said, behold, i have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face-turns of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it be for meat.and to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, i have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.and elohim-towards-these saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. and the evening and the morning were the sixth day.thus the namespacess and the earth were finished, and all the troop-cluster of them.and on the seventh day elohim-towards-these ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.and elohim-towards-these knee-fluffy-blessed the seventh day, and dedicated-finished it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which elohim-towards-these created and made.these are the generations of the namespacess and of the earth when they were created, in the day that yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah elohim-towards-these made the earth and the namespacess,and every plant of the field before-turns it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before-turns it grew: for yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah elohim-towards-these had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man to till the ground.and there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face-turns of the ground.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah elohim-towards-these formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living being.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah elohim-towards-these planted a garden eastward in eden-eon; and there he put the man whom he had formed.and out of the ground made yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah elohim-towards-these to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and bad.and a river went out of eden-eon to from-waters the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads.the name of the first is pison-mouth-old: that is it which compasseth the whole land of havilah-sick, where there is gold;and the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the onyx-that-they father-child-stone.and the name of the second river is gihon-emerged: the same is it that compasseth the whole land of cush-spindle-spindle.and the name of the third river is hiddekel-trunk-palm: that is it which goeth toward the east of assyria-beech-tree. and the fourth river is euphrates-cow.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah elohim-towards-these took the man, and put him into the garden of eden-eon to dress it and to keep it.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah elohim-towards-these order-prescribed the man, saying, of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat:and of the tree of the knowledge of god and bad, no eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou surely die.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah elohim-towards-these said, it is not good that the man should be alone; i will make him a helping counter-touch for him.and out of the ground yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah elohim-towards-these formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto adam-earth-blood-man to see what he would call them: and whatsoever adam-earth-blood-man called every living creature, that was the name thereof.and adam-earth-blood-man gave names to all in-them-animal, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; and for adam-earth-blood-man there was not found a helping counter-touch for him.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah elohim-towards-these caused a deep sleep to fall upon adam-earth-blood-man, and he slept: and he took one of his side-zolea-ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof;and the rib, which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah elohim-towards-these had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man.and adam-earth-blood-man said, this is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she be called woman, because she was taken out of man.therefore a man leave his father and his mother, and cleave unto his woman: and they be one flesh.and they were both naked, the man and his woman, and were not ashamed.now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah elohim-towards-these had made. and he said unto the woman, yea, hath elohim-towards-these said, ye not eat of every tree of the garden?and the woman said unto the serpent, we may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:and of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, elohim-towards-these hath said, ye not eat of it, neither ye touch it, lest ye die.and the serpent said unto the woman, ye not surely die:for elohim-towards-these doth hand-know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes be opened, and ye be as elohim-towards-these, knowing good and bad.and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her man with her; and he did eat.and the eyes of them both were opened, and they hand-knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.and they heard the voice of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah elohim-towards-these walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and adam-earth-blood-man and his woman hid themselves from the presence of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah elohim-towards-these amongst the trees of the garden.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah elohim-towards-these called unto adam-earth-blood-man, and said unto him, where art thou?and he said, i heard thy voice in the garden, and i was afraid, because i was naked; and i hid myself.and he said, who told thee that thou wast naked? hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof i order-prescribed thee that thou shouldest not eat?and the man said, the woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and i did eat.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah elohim-towards-these said unto the woman, what is this that thou hast done? and the woman said, the serpent beguiled me, and i did eat.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah elohim-towards-these said unto the serpent, because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all in-them-animal, and above every beast of the field; upon thy nurture-belly thou go, and dust thou eat all the days of thy life:and i will put enmity between-bin thee and the woman, and between-bin thy seed and her seed; it bruise thy head, and thou bruise his heel-jacob-backstreet.unto the woman he said, i will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou bring forth children-betweens; and thy desire be to thy man, and he rule over thee.and unto adam-earth-blood-man he said, because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy woman, and hast eaten of the tree, of which i order-prescribed thee, saying, no eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow thou eat of it all the days of thy life;thorns also and thistles it bring forth to thee; and thou eat the herb of the field;in the sweat of thy face-turns thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust thou return.and adam-earth-blood-man called his woman's name eve -biosphere; because she was the mother of all living.unto adam-earth-blood-man also and to his woman did yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah elohim-towards-these make you-wrote-coats of light-skins, and clothed them.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah elohim-towards-these said, behold, the man is become as one of us, to hand-know good and bad: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:therefore yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah elohim-towards-these sent him forth from the garden of eden-eon, to till the ground from whence he was taken.so he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of eden-eon inward-cherubims-multi-intern, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.and adam-earth-blood-man hand-knew eve -biosphere his woman; and she climaxed-tahar, and conceived-of cain-cell, and said, i have gotten a man from yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah.and she again conceived-of his brother abel-vapor. and abel-vapor was a keeper of sheep, and cain-cell was a tiller of the ground.and in process of time it came to pass, that cain-cell brought of the fruit of the ground an rest-absorber unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah.and abel-vapor, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah had respect unto abel-vapor and to his rest-absorber:and unto cain-cell and to his rest-absorber he had not respect. and cain-cell was very wroth, and his countenance fell.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah said unto cain-cell, why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen?if thou doest well, thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, miss lieth at the opening. and unto thee be his desire, and thou rule over him.and cain-cell talked with abel-vapor his brother: and it came to pass, when they were in the field, that cain-cell rose up against abel-vapor his brother, and slew him.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah said unto cain-cell, where is abel-vapor thy brother? and he said, i hand-know not: am i my brother's keeper?and he said, what hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground.and now art thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand;when thou tillest the ground, it not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond thou be in the earth.and cain-cell said unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, my punishment is greater than i can bear.behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face-turns of the earth; and from thy face-turns i be hid; and i be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it come to pass, that every one that findeth me slay me.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah said unto him, therefore whosoever slayeth cain-cell, vengeance be taken on him sevenfold. and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah set a mark upon cain-cell, lest any finding him should kill him.and cain-cell went out from the presence of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, and dwelt in the land of nodi-nomadic, on the east of eden-eon.and cain-cell hand-knew his woman; and she conceived, and conceived-of enoch-teach: and he between-between-builded a light-city, and called the name of the light-city, after the name of his child-between, enoch-teach.and unto enoch-teach was born irad-descend-bronze: and irad-descend-bronze begat towards-from-live: and towards-from-live begat towards-weakening: and towards-weakening begat lamech-fool.and lamech-fool took unto him two women: the name of the one was adah-witness, and the name of the other zillah-shadow.and adah-witness conceived-of jabal-spend-time: he was the father of such as dwell in tents, and of such as have in-them-animal.and his brother's name was jubal-river: he was the father of all such as handle the harp and organ.and zillah-shadow, she also conceived-of tubal-worldcain-seasoned-cell, an instructer of every artificer in brass and iron: and the sister of tubal-worldcain-seasoned-cell was naamah-pleasant.and lamech-fool said unto his women, adah-witness and zillah-shadow, hear my voice; ye women of lamech-fool, hearken unto my speech: for i have slain a man to my wounding, and a young man to my hurt.if cain-cell be avenged sevenfold, truly lamech-fool seventy and sevenfold.and adam-earth-blood-man hand-knew his woman again; and she conceived-of a child-between, and called his name seth-set: for elohim-towards-these, said she, hath set me up with another seed instead of abel-vapor, whom cain-cell slew.and to seth-set, to him also there was born a child-between; and he called his name enos-man: then began men to call upon the name of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah.this is the book of the generations of adam-earth-blood-man. in the day that elohim-towards-these created man, in the likeness of elohim-towards-these made he him;rememberer and pierced created he them; and knee-fluffy-blessed them, and called their name adam-earth-blood-man, in the day when they were created.and adam-earth-blood-man lived an hundred and thirty years, and begat a child-between in his own likeness, and after his image; and called his name seth-set:and the days of adam-earth-blood-man after he had begotten seth-set were eight hundred years: and he begat children-betweens and children-betweenesss:and all the days that adam-earth-blood-man lived were nine hundred and thirty years: and he died.and seth-set lived an hundred and five years, and begat enos-man:and seth-set lived after he begat enos-man eight hundred and seven years, and begat children-betweens and children-betweenesss:and all the days of seth-set were nine hundred and twelve years: and he died.and enos-man lived ninety years, and begat cain-cellan:and enos-man lived after he begat cain-cellan eight hundred and fifteen years, and begat children-betweens and children-betweenesss:and all the days of enos-man were nine hundred and five years: and he died.and cain-cellan lived seventy years and begat mahalaleel-praise-towards:and cain-cellan lived after he begat mahalaleel-praise-towards eight hundred and forty years, and begat children-betweens and children-betweenesss:and all the days of cain-cellan were nine hundred and ten years: and he died.and mahalaleel-praise-towards lived sixty and five years, and begat jared-come-down:and mahalaleel-praise-towards lived after he begat jared-come-down eight hundred and thirty years, and begat children-betweens and children-betweenesss:and all the days of mahalaleel-praise-towards were eight hundred ninety and five years: and he died.and jared-come-down lived an hundred sixty and two years, and he begat enoch-teach:and jared-come-down lived after he begat enoch-teach eight hundred years, and begat children-betweens and children-betweenesss:and all the days of jared-come-down were nine hundred sixty and two years: and he died.and enoch-teach lived sixty and five years, and begat methuselah-death-brings:and enoch-teach walked with elohim-towards-these after he begat methuselah-death-brings three hundred years, and begat children-betweens and children-betweenesss:and all the days of enoch-teach were three hundred sixty and five years:and enoch-teach walked with elohim-towards-these: and he was not; for elohim-towards-these took him.and methuselah-death-brings lived an hundred eighty and seven years, and begat lamech-fool.and methuselah-death-brings lived after he begat lamech-fool seven hundred eighty and two years, and begat children-betweens and children-betweenesss:and all the days of methuselah-death-brings were nine hundred sixty and nine years: and he died.and lamech-fool lived an hundred eighty and two years, and begat a child-between:and he called his name noah-rest, saying, this same rest us concerning our work and toil of our hands, because of the ground which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah hath cursed.and lamech-fool lived after he begat noah-rest five hundred ninety and five years, and begat children-betweens and children-betweenesss:and all the days of lamech-fool were seven hundred seventy and seven years: and he died.and noah-rest was five hundred years old: and noah-rest begat shem-name, ham-hot, and japheth-beautiful.and it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face-turns of the earth, and children-betweenesss were born unto them,that the he children-betweens of elohim-towards-these saw the she children-betweens of men that they were fair; and they took them women of all which they chose.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah said, my breath-spirit not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days be an hundred and double-ten-twenty years.there were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when children-betweens of elohim-towards-these came in unto children-betweenesss of men, and they conceived-of children-betweens to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown.and elohim-towards-these saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only bad continually.and it repented yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah said, i will destroy man whom i have created from the face-turns of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that i have made them.and noah-rest found attractiveness in the eyes of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah.these are the generations of noah-rest: noah-rest was a just man and perfect in his generations, and noah-rest walked with elohim-towards-these.and noah-rest begat three children-betweens, shem-name, ham-hot, and japheth-beautiful.the earth also was corrupt before-turns elohim-towards-these, and the earth was filled with violence.and elohim-towards-these looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.and elohim-towards-these said unto noah-rest, the end of all flesh is come before-turns me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, i will destroy them with the earth.make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms thou make in the ark, and pitch it within and without with pitch.and this is the fashion which thou make it of: the length of the ark be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.a window thou make to the ark, and in a cubit thou finish it above; and the opening of the ark thou set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories thou make it.and, behold, i, even i, do bring a flood of from-waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under namespaces; and every thing that is in the earth die.and with thee will i establish my covenant; and thou come into the ark, thou, and thy children-betweens, and thy woman, and thy children-betweens' women with thee.and of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they be rememberer and pierced.of fowls after their kind, and of in-them-animal after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every sort come unto thee, to keep them alive.and take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou gather it to thee; and it be for food for thee, and for them.thus did noah-rest; according to all that elohim-towards-these order-prescribed him, so did he.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah said unto noah-rest, come thou and all thy daughter-house into the ark; for thee have i seen just before-turns me in this generation.of every bright-climaxing beast thou take to thee by sevens, the rememberer and his pierced: and of beasts that are not bright-climaxing by two, the rememberer and his pierced.of fowls also of the air by sevens, the rememberer and the pierced; to keep seed alive upon the face-turns of all the earth.for yet seven days, and i will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights; and every living substance that i have made will i destroy from off the face-turns of the earth.and noah-rest did according unto all that yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah order-prescribed him.and noah-rest was six hundred years old when the flood of from-waters was upon the earth.and noah-rest went in, and his children-betweens, and his woman, and his children-betweens' women with him, into the ark, because of the from-waters of the flood.of bright-climaxing beasts, and of beasts that are not bright-climaxing, and of fowls, and of every thing that creepeth upon the earth,there went in two and two unto noah-rest into the ark, the rememberer and the pierced, as elohim-towards-these had order-prescribed noah-rest.and it came to pass after seven days, that the from-waters of the flood were upon the earth.in the six hundredth year of noah-rest's life, in the second month, the seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of namespaces were opened.and the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights.in the selfsame day entered noah-rest, and shem-name, and ham-hot, and japheth-beautiful, children-betweens of noah-rest, and noah-rest's woman, and the three women of his children-betweens with them, into the ark;they, and every beast after his kind, and all the in-them-animal after their kind, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind, and every fowl after his kind, every bird of every sort.and they went in unto noah-rest into the ark, two and two of all flesh, wherein is the breath of life.and they that went in, went in rememberer and pierced of all flesh, as elohim-towards-these had order-prescribed him: and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah shut him in.and the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the from-waters increased, and conceived-of up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth.and the from-waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the face-turns of the from-waters.and the from-waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high hills, that were under the whole namespaces, were covered.fifteen cubits upward did the from-waters prevail; and the mountains were covered.and all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of in-them-animal, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man:all in whose nostrils was the breath of life, of all that was in the dry land, died.and every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face-turns of the ground, both man, and in-them-animal, and the creeping things, and the fowl of the namespaces; and they were destroyed from the earth: and noah-rest only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark.and the from-waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty days.and elohim-towards-these remembered noah-rest, and every living thing, and all the in-them-animal that was with him in the ark: and elohim-towards-these made a wind to pass over the earth, and the from-waters assuaged;the fountains also of the deep and the windows of namespaces were stopped, and the rain from namespaces was restrained;and the from-waters returned from off the earth continually: and after the end of the hundred and fifty days the from-waters were abated.and the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, upon the mountains of ararat-appeal.and the from-waters decreased continually until the tenth month: in the tenth month, on the first day of the month, were the tops of the mountains seen.and it came to pass at the end of forty days, that noah-rest opened the window of the ark which he had made:and he sent forth a evening-raven, which went forth to and fro, until the from-waters were dried up from off the earth.also he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the from-waters were abated from off the face-turns of the ground;and the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she returned unto him into the ark, for the from-waters were on the face-turns of the whole earth: then he put forth his hand, and took her, and pulled her in unto him into the ark.and he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark;and the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her mouth was an olive leaf plucked off: so noah-rest hand-knew that the from-waters were abated from off the earth.and he stayed yet other seven days; and sent forth the dove; which returned not again unto him any more.and it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the from-waters were dried up from off the earth: and noah-rest removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face-turns of the ground was dry.and in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, was the earth dried.and elohim-towards-these spake unto noah-rest, saying,go forth of the ark, thou, and thy woman, and thy children-betweens, and thy children-betweens' women with thee.bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee, of all flesh, both of fowl, and of in-them-animal, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth.and noah-rest went forth, and his children-betweens, and his woman, and his children-betweens' women with him:every beast, every creeping thing, and every fowl, and whatsoever creepeth upon the earth, after their kinds, went forth out of the ark.and noah-rest between-between-builded an butcher-kitchen unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah; and took of every bright-climaxing beast, and of every bright-climaxing fowl, and rose on-ups on the butcher-kitchen.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah smelled a smell fragrance; and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah said in his heart, i will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake; for the imagination of man's heart is bad from his youth; neither will i again hit any more every thing living, as i have done.while the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night not cease.and elohim-towards-these knee-fluffy-blessed noah-rest and his children-betweens, and said unto them, be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.and the fear of you and the dread of you be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered.every moving thing that liveth be meat for you; even as the green herb have i given you all things.and flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof, ye not eat.and surely your blood of your lives will i require; at the hand of every beast will i require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man's brother will i require the life of man.whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man his blood be shed: for in the image of elohim-towards-these made he man.and you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; bring forth abundantly in the earth, and multiply therein.and elohim-towards-these spake unto noah-rest, and to his children-betweens with him, saying,and i, behold, i establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after you;and with every living creature that is with you, of the fowl, of the in-them-animal, and of every beast of the earth with you; from all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth.and i will establish my covenant with you, neither all flesh be cut off any more by the from-waters of a flood; neither there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.and elohim-towards-these said, this is the token of the covenant which i make between-bin me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations:i do set my bow in the cloud, and it be for a token of a covenant between-bin me and the earth.and it come to pass, when i bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow be seen in the cloud:and i will remember my covenant, which is between-bin me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the from-waters no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.and the bow be in the cloud; and i will look upon it, that i may remember the everlasting covenant between-bin elohim-towards-these and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth.and elohim-towards-these said unto noah-rest, this is the token of the covenant, which i have established between-bin me and all flesh that is upon the earth.and children-betweens of noah-rest, that went forth of the ark, were shem-name, and ham-hot, and japheth-beautiful: and ham-hot is the father of canaan-mobile-trade.these are the three children-betweens of noah-rest: and of them was the whole earth overspread.and noah-rest began to be an manman, and he planted a vineyard:and he drank of the wine-inherit, and was drunken; and he was uncovered within his tent.and ham-hot, the father of canaan-mobile-trade, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without.and shem-name and japheth-beautiful took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their face-turns-turns were backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness.and noah-rest awoke from his wine-inherit, and hand-knew what his younger child-between had done unto him.and he said, cursed be canaan-mobile-trade; a worker of workers he be unto his brethren.and he said, knee-fluffy-blessed be yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah elohim-towards-these of shem-name; and canaan-mobile-trade be his worker.elohim-towards-these beautify japheth-beautiful, and he dwell in the tents of shem-name; and canaan-mobile-trade be his worker.and noah-rest lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years.and all the days of noah-rest were nine hundred and fifty years: and he died.now these are the generations of children-betweens of noah-rest, shem-name, ham-hot, and japheth-beautiful: and unto them were children-betweens born after the flood.children-betweens of japheth-beautiful; gomer-final, and magog-from-roof, and madai-every, and javan-mud-greece, and tubal-world, and meshech-duration, and tiras-corn-swimming.and children-betweens of gomer-final; ashkenaz-fire-conference, and riphath-cowshed, and togarmah-produced.and children-betweens of javan-mud-greece; elisha-towards-savesh-towards-kneading, and tarshish-aquamarine, kittim-stains, and dodanim-nipple-dudes.by these were the isles of the nations branched-off in their lands; every one after his tongue, after their families, in their nations.and children-betweens of ham-hot; cush-spindle, and mizraim-narrows, and phut, and canaan-mobile-trade.and children-betweens of cush-spindle; seba-grandpa, and havilah-sick, and sabta-grandma, and raamah-thunder-mane, and sabtecha: and children-betweens of raamah-thunder-mane; sheba-coming, and dedan-breast-discuss.and cush-spindle begat nimrod-rebellious: he began to be a mighty one in the earth.he was a mighty hunter before-turns yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah: wherefore it is said, even as nimrod-rebellious the mighty hunter before-turns yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah.and the beginning of his moloch-kingdom was babel-old, and erech-lasting-uruk, and accad-jug, and calneh-all-lodgings, in the land of shinar-youth.out of that land went forth asshur-beech, and between-between-builded nineveh-house, and the light-city rehob-wideoth-wide-area, and calah-out-of-date,and resen-bridle between-bin nineveh-house and calah-out-of-date: the same is a great light-city.and mizraim-narrows begat lud-birthim-birth, and anamim-grapes, and lehabim-blades, and naphtuhim-open,and pathrusim-solutions, and casluhim-as-releasedess, (out of whom came philistim-invaders,) and caphtor-button-solvedim-buttons.and canaan-mobile-trade begat sidon-side-by-side his first born, and heth-bold,and the jebusite-trampler, and the amorite-talker, and the girgasite-emotional,and the hivite-experience, and the araktie-ground, and the sinite-bush,and the arvadite-bronze, and the zemarite-wool, and the ham-hotathite: and afterward were the families of the canaan-mobile-tradeites spread abroad.and the border of the canaan-mobile-tradeites was from sidon-side-by-side, as thou comest to gera-strangerr-tow, unto gaza-courage-intense-goat; as thou goest, unto sodom-splint-blood, and gomorrah-sheaves, and admah-earth, and zeboim-swollen, even unto lasha-watch.these are children-betweens of ham-hot, after their families, after their tongues, in their countries, and in their nations.unto shem-name also, the father of all children-betweens of eber-pass, the brother of japheth-beautiful the elder, even to him were children-betweens born.children-betweens of shem-name; elam-youth, and asshur-beech, and arpakhshad-breast, and lud-birth, and aram-high.and children-betweens of aram-high; uz-goose, and hul-sand, and gether-loosened-wine-inheritpress, and mash-draw.and arpakhshad-breast begat salah-send; and salah-send begat eber-pass.and unto eber-pass were born two children-betweens: the name of one was peleg-divided; for in his days was the earth divided; and his brother's name was joktan-little.and joktan-little begat almodad-measured-mute, and sheleph-stubble, and death-yard, and jerah-moon,and hadoram-their-generation, and uz-gooseal, and diklah-her-palm,and out-worn, and towards-my-father-from, and sheba-coming,and ophir-ash, and havilah-sick, and job-bringab-crying: all these were children-betweens of joktan-little.and their dwelling was from mesha-load, as thou goest unto sephar-book a mount of the east.these are children-betweens of shem-name, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, after their nations.these are the families of children-betweens of noah-rest, after their generations, in their nations: and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.and the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech.and it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that they found a plain in the land of shinar-youth; and they dwelt there.and they said one to another, go to, let us make brick-l-between, and burn them thoroughly. and they had brick-l-between for father-child-stone, and slime had they for mortar.and they said, go to, let us between-build us a light-city and a tower, whose top may reach unto namespaces; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face-turns of the whole earth.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah came down to see the light-city and the tower, which children-betweens of men between-between-builded.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah said, behold, the with-mum-people is one, and they have all one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have initiated to do.go to, let us go down, and there wear-out their language, that they may not hear one another's speech.so yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah scattered them abroad from thence upon the face-turns of all the earth: and they left off to between-build the light-city.therefore is the name of it called babel-old; because yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah did there wear out the language of all the earth: and from thence did yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah scatter them abroad upon the face-turns of all the earth.these are the generations of shem-name: shem was an hundred years old, and begat arpakhshad-breast two years after the flood:and shem-name lived after he begat arpakhshad-breast five hundred years, and begat children-betweens and children-betweenesss.and arpakhshad-breast lived five and thirty years, and begat salah-send:and arpakhshad-breast lived after he begat salah-send four hundred and three years, and begat children-betweens and children-betweenesss.and salah-send lived thirty years, and begat eber-pass:and salah-send lived after he begat eber-pass four hundred and three years, and begat children-betweens and children-betweenesss.and eber-pass lived four and thirty years, and begat peleg-divided:and eber-pass lived after he begat peleg-divided four hundred and thirty years, and begat children-betweens and children-betweenesss.and peleg-divided lived thirty years, and begat reu-buddy:and peleg-divided lived after he begat reu-buddy two hundred and nine years, and begat children-betweens and children-betweenesss.and reu-buddy lived two and thirty years, and begat serug-immersed-moment:and reu-buddy lived after he begat serug-immersed-moment two hundred and seven years, and begat children-betweens and children-betweenesss.and serug-immersed-moment lived thirty years, and begat nahor-snore:and serug-immersed-moment lived after he begat nahor-snore two hundred years, and begat children-betweens and children-betweenesss.and nahor-snore lived nine and double-ten-twenty years, and begat terah-effort:and nahor-snore lived after he begat terah-effort an hundred and nineteen years, and begat children-betweens and children-betweenesss.and terah-effort lived seventy years, and begat abram-boner, nahor-snore, and haran-conceived-gladness.now these are the generations of terah-effort: terah-effort begat abram-boner, nahor-snore, and haran-conceived-gladness; and haran-conceived-gladness begat lot-cover.and haran-conceived-gladness died before-turns his father terah-effort in the land of his nativity, in ur-light of the kasidim-as-genies.and abram-boner and nahor-snore took them women: the name of abram-boner's woman was sarai-my-soakedness; and the name of nahor-snore's woman, milcah-queen, the daughter-hoof-bat-child of haran-conceived-gladness, the father of milcah-queen, and the father of iscah-lube-sum.and sarai-my-soakedness was barren; she had no child.and terah-effort took abram-boner his child-between, and lot-cover child-between of haran-conceived-gladness his child-between's child-between, and sarai-my-soakedness his daughter-hoof-bat-child in teaching, his child-between abram-boner's woman; and they went forth with them from ur-light of the kasidim-as-genies, to go into the land of canaan-mobile-trade; and they came unto haran-conceived-gladness, and dwelt there.and the days of terah-effort were two hundred and five years: and terah-effort died in haran-conceived-gladness.now yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah had said unto abram-boner, get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's daughter-house, unto a land that i will show thee:and i will make of thee a great nation, and i will knee-fluffy-bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou be a knee-fluffy-blessing:and i will knee-fluffy-bless them that knee-fluffy-bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee all families of the earth be knee-fluffy-blessed.so abram-boner departed, as yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah had bee-spoken unto him; and lot-cover went with him: and abram-boner was seventy and five years old when he departed out of haran-conceived-gladness.and abram-boner took sarai-my-soakedness his woman, and lot-cover his brother's child-between, and all their substance that they had added, and the beings that they had gotten in haran-conceived-gladness; and they went forth to go into the land of canaan-mobile-trade; and into the land of canaan-mobile-trade they came.and abram-boner passed through the land unto the place of sichem, unto the plain of moreh-teacher. and the canaan-mobile-tradeite was then in the land.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah appeared unto abram-boner, and said, unto thy seed will i give this land: and there between-between-builded he an butcher-kitchen unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, who appeared unto him.and he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of bethel-house-of-towards, and pitched his tent, having bethel-house-of-towards on the sea-west, and hai on the east: and there he between-between-builded an butcher-kitchen unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, and called upon the name of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah.and abram-boner journeyed, going on still toward the south-dry.and there was a famine in the land: and abram-boner went down into mizraim-narrows to sojourn there; for the famine was grievous in the land.and it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into mizraim-narrows, that he said unto sarai-my-soakedness his woman, behold now, i hand-know that thou art a fair woman to look upon:therefore it come to pass, when the mizraim-narrowsians see thee, that they say, this is his woman: and they will kill me, and they will save thee alive.say, i pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with me for thy sake; and my being live because of thee.and it came to pass, that, when abram-boner was come into mizraim-narrows, the mizraim-narrowsians beheld the woman that she was very fair.the princes also of pharaoh-big-house saw her, and commended her before-turns pharaoh-big-house: and the woman was taken into pharaoh-big-house's daughter-house.and he entreated abram-boner well for her sake: and he had sheep, and wall-oxen, and he asses, and workers, and maid-mothers, and she asses, and ripen-camels.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah plagued pharaoh-big-house and his daughter-house with great plagues because of sarai-my-soakedness abram-boner's woman.and pharaoh-big-house called abram-boner and said, what is this that thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy woman?why saidst thou, she is my sister? so i might have taken her to me to woman: now therefore behold thy woman, take her, and go thy way.and pharaoh-big-house order-prescribed his men concerning him: and they sent him away, and his woman, and all that he had.and abram-boner went up out of mizraim-narrows, he, and his woman, and all that he had, and lot-cover with him, into the south-dry.and abram-boner was very rich in in-them-animal, in silver, and in gold.and he went on his journeys from the south-dry even to bethel-house-of-towards, unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between-bin bethel-house-of-towards and hai;unto the place of the butcher-kitchen, which he had make there at the first: and there abram-boner called on the name of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah.and lot-cover also, which went with abram-boner, had flocks, and visit-cattles, and tents.and the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together.and there was a strife between-bin the visit-cattlemen of abram-boner's in-them-animal and the visit-cattlemen of lot-cover's in-them-animal: and the canaan-mobile-tradeite and the perizzite-unwalled dwelled then in the land.and abram-boner said unto lot-cover, let there be no strife, i pray thee, between-bin me and thee, and between-bin my visit-cattlemen and thy visit-cattlemen; for we be brethren.is not the whole land before-turns thee? separate thyself, i pray thee, from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then i will go to the right; or if thou depart to the right hand, then i will go to the left.and lot-cover lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of jordan-its-going-down, that it was well watered every where, before-turns yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah destroyed sodom-splint-blood and gomorrah-sheaves, even as the garden of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, like the land of mizraim-narrows, as thou comest unto zoar-grief.then lot-cover chose him all the plain of jordan-its-going-down; and lot-cover journeyed east: and they separated themselves the one from the other.abram-boner dwelled in the land of canaan-mobile-trade, and lot-cover dwelled in the cities of the plain, and pitched his tent toward sodom-splint-blood.and the men of sodom-splint-blood were wicked and fauters before-turns yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah exceedingly.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah said unto abram-boner, after that lot-cover was separated from him, lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art hide-northward, and south-dryward, and eastward, and sea-westward:for all the land which thou seest, to thee will i give it, and to thy seed for ever.and i will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then thy seed also be numbered.arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it; for i will give it unto thee.then abram-boner removed his tent, and came and dwelt in the plain of mamre-see-bitter, which is in hebron-friend-joy, and between-built there an butcher-kitchen unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah.and it came to pass in the days of amraphel-falling-mother-shelf moloch-king of shinar-youth, arioch-gather-lion-smell moloch-king of ellasar-hazel, chedorlaomer-pot-sheave moloch-king of elam-youth, and tidal-throw moloch-king of nations;that these made war with bera-in-the-bad moloch-king of sodom-splint-blood, and with birscha-in-the-bad moloch-king of gomorrah-sheaves, shinab-changing-dad moloch-king of admah-earth, and shemeber-name-dick moloch-king of zeboiim-gazelles, and the moloch-king of bela-swallow, which is zoar-grief.all these were joined together in the vale of siddim-demons, which is the salt sea.twelve years they worked for chedorlaomer-pot-sheave, and in the thirteenth year they rebelled.and in the fourteenth year came chedorlaomer-pot-sheave, and the moloch-kings that were with him, and smote the rephaim-ghosts in ashteroth-you-gave-fire karnaim-horn-rays, and the zuzim-moves in ham-hot, and the emim-horrors in shaveh-equal kiriathaim-cold-cities,and the hori-my-holete-holes-mountain in their mount seir-hair-style, unto elparan, which is by the place-of-word-desert.and they returned, and came to enmishpat-eye-well-of-referee, which is kadesh-dedicated-finished, and smote all the country of the amalek-labour-moloch-kingites, and also the amorite-talkers, that dwelt in hazezontamar-gravel-date.and there went out the moloch-king of sodom-splint-blood, and the moloch-king of gomorrah-sheaves, and the moloch-king of admah-earth, and the moloch-king of zeboiim-gazelles, and the moloch-king of bela-swallow (the same is zoar-grief;) and they joined battle with them in the vale of siddim-demons;with chedorlaomer-pot-sheave the moloch-king of elam-youth, and with tidal-throw moloch-king of nations, and amraphel-falling-mother-shelf moloch-king of shinar-youth, and arioch-gather-lion-smell moloch-king of ellasar-hazel; four moloch-kings with five.and the vale of siddim-demons was full of slime pits; and the moloch-kings of sodom-splint-blood and gomorrah-sheaves fled, and fell there; and they that remained fled to the mountain.and they took all the goods of sodom-splint-blood and gomorrah-sheaves, and all their victuals, and went their way.and they took lot-cover, abram-boner's brother's child-between, who dwelt in sodom-splint-blood, and his goods, and departed.and there came one that had escaped, and told abram-boner the hebrew-cross-over; for he dwelt in the plain of mamre-see-bitter the amorite-talker, brother of eshcol-fire-all, and brother of aner-candle: and these were confederate with abram-boner.and when abram-boner heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his trained workers, born in his own daughter-house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued them unto dan-discuss.and he divided himself against them, he and his workers, by night, and smote them, and pursued them unto hobah-obligation, which is on the left hand of damascus-blood-bag.and he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his brother lot-cover, and his goods, and the women also, and the with-mum-people.and the moloch-king of sodom-splint-blood went out to until-witness him after his return from the slaughter of chedorlaomer-pot-sheave, and of the moloch-kings that were with him, at the valley of shaveh-equal, which is the moloch-king's dale.and melchizedek-just-moloch-king king of salem-peace brought forth bread and wine-inherit: and he was the dimmer-server of the most high elohim-towards-these.and he knee-fluffy-blessed him, and said, knee-fluffy-blessed be abram-boner of the most high elohim-towards-these, possessor of namespaces and earth:and knee-fluffy-blessed be the most high elohim-towards-these, which hath delivered thine father-adversaries into thy hand. and he gave him tithes of all.and the moloch-king of sodom-splint-blood said unto abram-boner, give me the persons, and take the goods to thyself.and abram-boner said to the moloch-king of sodom-splint-blood, i have lift up mine hand unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, the most high elohim-towards-these, the possessor of namespaces and earth,that i will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet, and that i will not take any thing that is thine, lest thou shouldest say, i have made abram-boner rich:save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men which went with me, aner-candle, eshcol-fire-all, and mamre-see-bitter; let them take their portion.after these things the bee-word of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah came unto abram-boner in a vision, saying, fear not, abram-boner: i am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward.and abram-boner said, yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah elohim-towards-these, what wilt thou give me, seeing i go childless, and the steward of my daughter-house is this eliezer-my-towards-helps of damascus-blood-bag?and abram-boner said, behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo, one born in my daughter-house is mine heir.and, behold, the bee-word of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah came unto him, saying, this not be thine heir; and he that come forth out of thine own bowels be thine heir.and he brought him forth abroad, and said, look now toward namespaces, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, so thy seed be.and he was coached by yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah; and he counted it to him for being right.and he said unto him, i am yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah that brought thee out of ur-light of the kasidim-as-genies, to give thee this land to network it.and he said, yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah elohim-towards-these, whereby i hand-know that i network it?and he said unto him, take me an heifer of three years old, and a she intense-goat of three years old, and a ram-voiceless of three years old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon.and he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each piece one against another: and the birds divided he not.and when the fowls came down upon the carcasses, abram-boner drove them away.and when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon abram-boner; and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him.and he said unto abram-boner, hand-know of a surety that thy seed be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and work for them; and they afflict them four hundred years;and also that nation, whom they work for, will i decide: and afterward they come out with great substance.and thou go to thy fathers in peace; thou be buried in a good old age.and in the fourth generation they come hither again: for the torment of the amorite-talkers is not yet full.and it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between-bin those pieces.in the same day yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah made a covenant with abram-boner, saying, unto thy seed have i given this land, from the river of mizraim-narrows unto the great river, the river euphrates-cow:the kenite-nests-nest, and the kenizzites, and the kadmonites-anterior,and the hittite-cuts-tusk, and the perizzite-unwalleds, and the rephaim-ghosts,and the amorite-talkers, and the canaan-mobile-tradeites, and the girgashites-emotional, and the jebusite-tramplers.now sarai-my-soakedness abram-boner's woman conceived-of him no children-betweens: and she had an handmaid, an mizraim-narrowsian, whose name was hagar-migrate.and sarai-my-soakedness said unto abram-boner, behold now, yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah hath restrained me from bearing: i pray thee, go in unto my maid; it may be that i may obtain children-betweens by her. and abram-boner hearkened to the voice of sarai-my-soakedness.and sarai-my-soakedness abram-boner's woman took hagar-migrate her maid the mizraim-narrowsian, after abram-boner had dwelt ten years in the land of canaan-mobile-trade, and gave her to her man abram-boner to be his woman.and he went in unto hagar-migrate, and she conceived: and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.and sarai-my-soakedness said unto abram-boner, my wrong be upon thee: i have given my maid into thy bosom; and when she saw that she had conceived, i was despised in her eyes: yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah decide between-bin me and thee.and abram-boner said unto sarai-my-soakedness, behold, thy maid is in thine hand; do to her as it pleaseth thee. and when sarai-my-soakedness dealt hardly with her, she fled from her face-turns.and the angel-messanger of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah found her by a fountain of from-waters in the place-of-word-desert, by the fountain in the way to shur-wall.and he said, hagar-migrate, sarai-my-soakedness's maid, whence camest thou? and whither wilt thou go? and she said, i flee from the face-turns of my mistress sarai-my-soakedness.and the angel-messanger of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah said unto her, return to thy mistress, and submit thyself under her hands.and the angel-messanger of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah said unto her, i will multiply thy seed exceedingly, that it not be numbered for multitude.and the angel-messanger of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah said unto her, behold, thou art with child and bear a child-between, and call his name ishmael-towards-hears; because yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah hath heard thy affliction.and he will be a wild man; his hand will be against every man, and every man's hand against him; and he dwell in the presence of all his brethren.and she called the name of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah that spake unto her, thou elohim-towards-these seest me: for she said, have i also here looked after him that seeth me?wherefore the well was called roi-well-cheek-see-beer-welllahai; behold, it is between-bin kadesh-dedicated-finished and bered-hail.and hagar-migrate conceived-of abram-boner a child-between: and abram-boner called his child-between's name, which hagar-migrate conceived-of, ishmael-towards-hears.and abram-boner was fourscore and six years old, when hagar-migrate conceived-of ishmael-towards-hears to abram-boner.and when abram-boner was ninety years old and nine, yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah appeared to abram-boner, and said unto him, i am the almighty elohim-towards-these; walk before-turns me, and be thou perfect.and i will make my covenant between-bin me and thee, and will multiply thee exceedingly.and abram-boner fell on his face-turns: and elohim-towards-these talked with him, saying,as for me, behold, my covenant is with thee, and thou be a father of many nations.neither thy name any more be called abram-boner, and thy name be abraham-their-dick; for a father of many nations have i made thee.and i will make thee exceeding fruitful, and i will make nations of thee, and moloch-kings come out of thee.and i will establish my covenant between-bin me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a elohim-towards-these unto thee, and to thy seed after thee.and i will give unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land wherein thou art a stranger, all the land of canaan-mobile-trade, for an everlasting possession; and i will be their elohim-towards-these.and elohim-towards-these said unto abraham-their-dick, thou keep my covenant therefore, thou, and thy seed after thee in their generations.this is my covenant, which ye keep, between-bin me and you and thy seed after thee; every man child among you be scribe-circumcised.and ye scribe-circumcise the flesh of your foreskin; and it be a token of the covenant betwixt-bin me and you.and he that is eight days old be scribe-circumcised among you, every man child in your generations, he that is born in the daughter-house, or bought with money of any stranger, which is not of thy seed.he that is born in thy daughter-house, and he that is bought with thy money, must needs be scribe-circumcised: and my covenant be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant.and the foreskinned man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not scribe-circumcised, that being be cut off from his with-mum-people; he hath broken my covenant.and elohim-towards-these said unto abraham-their-dick, as for sarai-my-soakedness thy woman, no call her name sarai-my-soakedness, and sarah-her-soakedness her name be.and i will knee-fluffy-bless her, and give thee a child-between also of her: yea, i will knee-fluffy-bless her, and she be a mother of nations; moloch-kings of with-mum-people be of her.then abraham-their-dick fell upon his face-turns, and laughed, and said in his heart, a child be born unto him that is an hundred years old? and sarah-her-soakedness, that is ninety years old, bear?and abraham-their-dick said unto elohim-towards-these, o that ishmael-towards-hears might live before-turns thee!and elohim-towards-these said, sarah-her-soakedness thy woman bear thee a child-between indeed; and thou call his name isaac-laughter: and i will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant, and with his seed after him.and as for ishmael-towards-hears, i have heard thee: behold, i have knee-fluffy-blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes he beget, and i will make him a great nation.and my covenant will i establish with isaac-laughter, which sarah-her-soakedness bear unto thee at this set time in the next year.and he left off talking with him, and elohim-towards-these went up from abraham-their-dick.and abraham-their-dick took ishmael-towards-hears his child-between, and all that were born in his daughter-house, and all that were bought with his money, every rememberer among the men of abraham-their-dick's daughter-house; and scribe-circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day, as elohim-towards-these had said unto him.and abraham-their-dick was ninety years old and nine, when he was scribe-circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.and ishmael-towards-hears his child-between was thirteen years old, when he was scribe-circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.in the selfsame day was abraham-their-dick scribe-circumcised, and ishmael-towards-hears his child-between.and all the men of his daughter-house, born in the daughter-house, and bought with money of the stranger, were scribe-circumcised with him.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah appeared unto him in the plains of mamre-see-bitter: and he sat in the tent opening in the heat of the day;and he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw them, he ran to until-witness them from the tent opening, and bowed himself toward the ground,and said, my yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, if now i have found favor in thy sight, pass not away, i pray thee, from thy worker:let a little from-waters, i pray you, be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree:and i will fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort ye your hearts; after that ye pass on: for therefore are ye come to your worker. and they said, so do, as thou hast said.and abraham-their-dick hastened into the tent unto sarah-her-soakedness, and said, make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes upon the hearth.and abraham-their-dick ran unto the visit-cattle, and fetched a calf tender and good, and gave it unto a young man; and he hasted to dress it.and he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before-turns them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.and they said unto him, where is sarah-her-soakedness thy woman? and he said, behold, in the tent.and he said, i will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and, lo, sarah-her-soakedness thy woman have a child-between. and sarah-her-soakedness heard it in the tent opening, which was behind him.now abraham-their-dick and sarah-her-soakedness were old and well stricken in age; and it ceased to be with sarah-her-soakedness after the manner of women.therefore sarah-her-soakedness laughed within herself, saying, after i am waxed old i have pleasure, my base-lord being old also?and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah said unto abraham-their-dick, wherefore did sarah-her-soakedness laugh, saying, i of a surety bear a child, which am old?is any thing too hard for yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah? at the time appointed i will return unto thee, according to the time of life, and sarah-her-soakedness have a child-between.then sarah-her-soakedness denied, saying, i laughed not; for she was afraid. and he said, nay; and thou didst laugh.and the men rose up from thence, and looked toward sodom-splint-blood: and abraham-their-dick went with them to bring them on the way.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah said, i hide from abraham-their-dick that thing which i do;seeing that abraham-their-dick surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth be knee-fluffy-blessed in him?for i hand-know him, that he will order-prescribe his children-betweens and his daughter-household after him, and they keep the way of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, to do being right and decision-grammar; that yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah may bring upon abraham-their-dick that which he hath bee-spoken of him.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah said, because the cry of sodom-splint-blood and gomorrah-sheaves is great, and because their miss is very grievous;i will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, i will hand-know.and the men turned their face-turns-turns from thence, and went toward sodom-splint-blood: and abraham-their-dick stood yet before-turns yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah.and abraham-their-dick drew near, and said, wilt thou also destroy the just with the wicked?peradventure there be fifty just within the light-city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty just that are therein?that be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the just with the wicked: and that the just should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: not the decide of all the earth do right?and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah said, if i find in sodom-splint-blood fifty just within the light-city, then i will spare all the place for their sakes.and abraham-their-dick answered and said, behold now, i have taken upon me to speak unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, which am and dust and ashes:peradventure there lack five of the fifty just: wilt thou destroy all the light-city for lack of five? and he said, if i find there forty and five, i will not destroy it.and he spake unto him yet again, and said, peradventure there be forty found there. and he said, i will not do it for forty's sake.and he said unto him, oh let not yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah be angry, and i will speak: peradventure there thirty be found there. and he said, i will not do it, if i find thirty there.and he said, behold now, i have taken upon me to speak unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah: peradventure there be double-ten-twenty found there. and he said, i will not destroy it for double-ten-twenty's sake.and he said, oh let not yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah be angry, and i will speak yet and this once: peradventure ten be found there. and he said, i will not destroy it for ten's sake.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah went his way, as soon as he had left communing with abraham-their-dick: and abraham-their-dick returned unto his place.and there came two angel-messangers to sodom-splint-blood at even; and lot-cover sat in the hair-gate of sodom-splint-blood: and lot-cover seeing them rose up to until-witness them; and he bowed himself with his face-turns toward the ground;and he said, behold now, my base-lords, turn in, i pray you, into your worker's daughter-house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye rise up early, and go on your ways. and they said, nay; and we will abide in the street all night.and he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and entered into his daughter-house; and he made them a until-conception, and did bake lit-mazat, and they did eat.and before-turns they lay down, the men of the light-city, even the men of sodom-splint-blood, compassed the daughter-house round, both old and young, all the with-mum-people from every quarter:and they called unto lot-cover, and said unto him, where are the men which came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may hand-know them.and lot-cover went out at the opening unto them, and shut the opening after him,and said, i pray you, brethren, do not so wickedly.behold now, i have two pierced children-betweens-bin which have not hand-known man; let me, i pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes: only unto these men do nothing; for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof.and they said, stand back. and they said again, this one fellow came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a decide: now will we deal worse with thee, than with them. and they pressed sore upon the man, even lot-cover, and came near to break the opening.and the men put forth their hand, and pulled lot-cover into the daughter-house to them, and shut to the opening.and they smote the men that were at the opening of the daughter-house with blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied themselves to find the opening.and the men said unto lot-cover, hast thou here any besides? child-between in teaching, and thy children-betweens, and thy children-betweenesss, and whatsoever thou hast in the light-city, bring them out of this place:for we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great before-turns the face-turns of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah; and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah hath sent us to destroy it.and lot-cover went out, and spake unto his children-betweens-in-teaching, which married his children-betweenesss, and said, up, get you out of this place; for yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah will destroy this light-city. and he seemed as one that mocked unto his children-betweens-in-teaching.and when the morning arose, then the angel-messangers hastened lot-cover, saying, arise, take thy woman, and thy two children-betweenesss, which are here; lest thou be consumed in the torment of the light-city.and while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his woman, and upon the hand of his two children-betweenesss; yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah being merciful unto him: and they brought him forth, and set him without the light-city.and it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.and lot-cover said unto them, oh, not so, my base-lord:behold now, thy worker hath found attractiveness in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast showed unto me in saving my life; and i cannot escape to the mountain, lest some bad take me, and i die:behold now, this light-city is near to flee unto, and it is a little one: oh, let me escape thither, (is it not a little one?) and my being live.and he said unto him, see, i have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that i will not overthrow this light-city, for the which thou hast bee-spoken.haste thee, escape thither; for i cannot do anything till thou be come thither. therefore the name of the light-city was called zoar-grief.the sun was risen upon the earth when lot-cover entered into zoar-grief.then yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah rained upon sodom-splint-blood and upon gomorrah-sheaves brimstone and fire from yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah out of namespaces;and he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.and his woman looked back from behind him, and she became a page-column-erection of salt.and abraham-their-dick gat up early in the morning to the place where he stood before-turns yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah:and he looked toward sodom-splint-blood and gomorrah-sheaves, and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace.and it came to pass, when elohim-towards-these destroyed the cities of the plain, that elohim-towards-these remembered abraham-their-dick, and sent lot-cover out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which lot-cover dwelt.and lot-cover went up out of zoar-grief, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two children-betweenesss with him; for he feared to dwell in zoar-grief: and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two children-betweenesss.and the firstborn said unto the younger, our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth:come, let us make our father drink wine-inherit, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.and they made their father drink wine-inherit that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.and it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto the younger, behold, i lay yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine-inherit this night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.and they made their father drink wine-inherit that night also: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.thus were both children-betweenesss of lot-cover with child by their father.and the first born conceived-of a child-between, and called his name moab-from-father: the same is the father of the moab-from-fatherites unto this day.and the younger, she also conceived-of a child-between, and called his name me-between-with: the same is the father of children-betweens of ammon-with unto this day.and abraham-their-dick journeyed from thence toward the south-dry country, and dwelled between-bin kadesh-dedicated-finished and shur-wall, and sojourned in gera-strangerr-tow.and abraham-their-dick said of sarah-her-soakedness his woman, she is my sister: and abimelech-my-dad-moloch-king king of gera-strangerr-tow sent, and took sarah-her-soakedness.and elohim-towards-these came to abimelech-my-dad-moloch-king in a dream by night, and said to him, behold, thou art and a dead man, for the woman which thou hast taken; for she is a man's woman.and abimelech-my-dad-moloch-king had not come near her: and he said, my base-lord, wilt thou slay also a just nation?said he not unto me, she is my sister? and she, even she herself said, he is my brother: in the integrity of my heart and innocency of my hands have i done this.and elohim-towards-these said unto him in a dream, yea, i hand-know that thou didst this in the integrity of thy heart; for i also withheld thee from missing against me: therefore suffered i thee not to touch her.now therefore restore the man his woman; for he is a bringer, and he pray for thee, and thou live: and if thou restore her not, hand-know thou that thou surely die, thou, and all that are thine.therefore abimelech-my-dad-moloch-king rose early in the morning, and called all his workers, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were sore afraid.then abimelech-my-dad-moloch-king called abraham-their-dick, and said unto him, what hast thou done unto us? and what have i offended thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my moloch-kingdom a great miss? thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done.and abimelech-my-dad-moloch-king said unto abraham-their-dick, what sawest thou, that thou hast done this thing?and abraham-their-dick said, because i thought, surely the fear of elohim-towards-these is not in this place; and they will slay me for my woman's sake.and yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter-hoof-bat-child of my father, and not the daughter-hoof-bat-child of my mother; and she became my woman.and it came to pass, when elohim-towards-these caused me to wander from my father's daughter-house, that i said unto her, this is thy kindness which thou show unto me; at every place whither we come, say of me, he is my brother.and abimelech-my-dad-moloch-king took sheep, and wall-oxen, and workers, and familiars, and gave them unto abraham-their-dick, and restored him sarah-her-soakedness his woman.and abimelech-my-dad-moloch-king said, behold, my land is before-turns thee: dwell where it pleaseth thee.and unto sarah-her-soakedness he said, behold, i have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver: behold, he is to thee a covering of the eyes, unto all that are with thee, and with all other: thus she was reproved.so abraham-their-dick prayed unto elohim-towards-these: and elohim-towards-these healed abimelech-my-dad-moloch-king, and his woman, and his maid-mothers; and they conceived-of children.for yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah had fast closed up all the wombs of the daughter-house of abimelech-my-dad-moloch-king, because of sarah-her-soakedness abraham-their-dick's woman.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah visited sarah-her-soakedness as he had said, and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah did unto sarah-her-soakedness as he had bee-spoken.for sarah-her-soakedness conceived, and conceived-of abraham-their-dick a child-between in his old age, at the set time of which elohim-towards-these had bee-spoken to him.and abraham-their-dick called the name of his child-between that was born unto him, whom sarah-her-soakedness conceived-of to him, isaac-laughter.and abraham-their-dick scribe-circumcised his child-between isaac-laughter being eight days old, as elohim-towards-these had order-prescribed him.and abraham-their-dick was an hundred years old, when his child-between isaac-laughter was born unto him.and sarah-her-soakedness said, elohim-towards-these hath made me to laugh, so that all that hear will laugh with me.and she said, who would have said unto abraham-their-dick, that sarah-her-soakedness should have given children-betweens suck? for i have born him a child-between in his old age.and child grew, and was weaned: and abraham-their-dick made a great until-conception the same day that isaac-laughter was weaned.and sarah-her-soakedness saw child-between of hagar-migrate the mizraim-narrowsian, which she had born unto abraham-their-dick, mocking.wherefore she said unto abraham-their-dick, cast out this bondwoman and her child-between: for child-between of this bondwoman not be heir with my child-between, even with isaac-laughter.and the thing was very grievous in abraham-their-dick's sight because of his child-between.and elohim-towards-these said unto abraham-their-dick, let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that sarah-her-soakedness hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in isaac-laughter thy seed be called.and also of child-between of the bondwoman will i make a nation, because he is thy seed.and abraham-their-dick rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle of from-waters, and gave it unto hagar-migrate, putting it on her shoulder, and child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in the place-of-word-desert of beer-wellsheba-well-of-seven-swear.and the from-waters was spent in the bottle, and she cast child under one of the shrubs.and she went, and sat her down over against him a good way off, as it were a bow shot: for she said, let me not see the death of child. and she sat over against him, and lift up her voice, and wept.and elohim-towards-these heard the voice of the lad; and the angel-messanger of elohim-towards-these called to hagar-migrate out of namespaces, and said unto her, what aileth thee, hagar-migrate? fear not; for elohim-towards-these hath heard the voice of the lad where he is.arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thine hand; for i will make him a great nation.and elohim-towards-these opened her eyes, and she saw a well of from-waters; and she went, and filled the bottle with from-waters, and gave the lad drink.and elohim-towards-these was with the lad; and he grew, and dwelt in the place-of-word-desert, and became an archer.and he dwelt in the place-of-word-desert of paran-magnificence: and his mother took him a woman out of the land of mizraim-narrows.and it came to pass at that time, that abimelech-my-dad-moloch-king and phichol-mouth-of-all the chief captain of his troop-cluster spake unto abraham-their-dick, saying, elohim-towards-these is with thee in all that thou doest:now therefore swear unto me here by elohim-towards-these that thou wilt not deal falsely with me, nor with my child-between, nor with my child-between's child-between: and according to the kindness that i have done unto thee, thou do unto me, and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned.and abraham-their-dick said, i will swear.and abraham-their-dick reproved abimelech-my-dad-moloch-king because of a well of from-waters, which abimelech-my-dad-moloch-king's workers had violently taken away.and abimelech-my-dad-moloch-king said, i wot not who hath done this thing; neither didst thou tell me, neither yet heard i of it, and to day.and abraham-their-dick took sheep and wall-oxen, and gave them unto abimelech-my-dad-moloch-king; and both of them made a covenant.and abraham-their-dick set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.and abimelech-my-dad-moloch-king said unto abraham-their-dick, what mean these seven ewe lambs which thou hast set by themselves?and he said, for these seven ewe lambs thou take of my hand, that they may be a witness unto me, that i have digged this well.wherefore he called that place beer-wellsheba-well-of-seven-swear; because there they sware both of them.thus they made a covenant at beer-wellsheba-well-of-seven-swear: then abimelech-my-dad-moloch-king rose up, and phichol-mouth-of-all the chief captain of his troop-cluster, and they returned into the land of the philistines-griever.and abraham-their-dick planted a grove in beer-wellsheba-well-of-seven-swear, and called there on the name of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, the everlasting elohim-towards-these.and abraham-their-dick sojourned in the philistines-griever' land many days.and it came to pass after these things, that elohim-towards-these did tempt abraham-their-dick, and said unto him, abraham-their-dick: and he said, behold, here i am.and he said, take now thy child-between, thine only child-between isaac-laughter, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of moriah-bitter-teacher; and inward him there for a on-up upon one of the mountains which i will tell thee of.and abraham-their-dick rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and isaac-laughter his child-between, and clave the wood for the on-up, and rose up, and went unto the place of which elohim-towards-these had told him.then on the third day abraham-their-dick lifted up his eyes, and saw the place afar off.and abraham-their-dick said unto his young men, abide ye here with the ass; and i and the lad will go yonder and partake-shatakh, and come again to you.and abraham-their-dick took the wood of the on-up, and laid it upon isaac-laughter his child-between; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife; and they went both of them together.and isaac-laughter spake unto abraham-their-dick his father, and said, my father: and he said, here am i, my child-between. and he said, behold the fire and the wood: and where is the lamb for a on-up?and abraham-their-dick said, my child-between, elohim-towards-these will provide himself a lamb for a on-up: so they went both of them together.and they came to the stand-up-place which elohim-towards-these had told him of; and abraham-their-dick between-built an butcher-kitchen there, and laid the wood in order, and bound isaac-laughter his child-between, and laid him on the butcher-kitchen upon the wood.and abraham-their-dick stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his child-between.and the angel-messanger of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah called unto him out of namespaces, and said, abraham-their-dick, abraham-their-dick: and he said, here am i.and he said, lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now i hand-know that thou fearest elohim-towards-these, seeing thou hast not withheld thy child-between, thine only child-between from me.and abraham-their-dick lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind him a ram-voiceless caught in a thicket by his horn-rays: and abraham-their-dick went and took the ram-voiceless, and inwarded him up for a on-up in the stead of his child-between.and abraham-their-dick called the name of that place yhwh-aeiou-ohyeahjireh: as it is said to this day, in the mount of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah it be seen.and the angel-messanger of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah called unto abraham-their-dick out of namespaces the second time,and said, by myself have i sworn, saith yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy child-between, thine only child-between:that in knee-fluffy-blessing i will knee-fluffy-bless thee, and in multiplying i will multiply thy seed as the stars of the namespaces, and as the sand which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed possess the hair-gate of his father-adversaries;and in thy seed all the nations of the earth be knee-fluffy-blessed; because thou hast heard my voice.so abraham-their-dick returned unto his young men, and they rose up and went together to beer-wellsheba-well-of-seven-swear; and abraham-their-dick dwelt at beer-wellsheba-well-of-seven-swear.and it came to pass after these things, that it was told abraham-their-dick, saying, behold, milcah-queen, she hath also born children-betweens unto thy brother nahor-snore;huz-advice his firstborn, and buz-scorn his brother, and kemuel-get-up-towards the father of aram-high,and chesed-as-a-demon, and hazo-predict, and pildash-fiery-iron, and jidlaph-leak, and bethuel-his-house-towards.and bethuel-his-house-towards begat rebekah-stall: these eight milcah-queen did bear to nahor-snore, abraham-their-dick's brother.and his concubine, whose name was reu-buddymah, she conceived-of also tebah-slaughter, and gaham-whim, and tahash-hurry, and maachah-from-acre.and sarah-her-soakedness was an hundred and seven and double-ten-twenty years old: these were the years of the life of sarah-her-soakedness.and sarah-her-soakedness died in kirjatharba-light-city-of-four; the same is hebron-friend-joy in the land of canaan-mobile-trade: and abraham-their-dick came to mourn for sarah-her-soakedness, and to weep for her.and abraham-their-dick stood up from before-turns his dead, and spake unto children-betweens of heth-bold, saying,i am a stranger and a sojourner with you: give me a possession of a buryingplace with you, that i may bury my dead out of my sight.and children-betweens of heth-bold answered abraham-their-dick, saying unto him,hear us, my base-lord: thou art a mighty prince among us: in the choice of our sepulchres bury thy dead; none of us withhold from thee his sepulchre, and that thou mayest bury thy dead.and abraham-their-dick stood up, and bowed himself to the with-mum-people of the land, even to children-betweens of heth-bold.and he communed with them, saying, if it be your mind that i should bury my dead out of my sight; hear me, and entreat for me to ephron-pencil child-between of zohar-bleach,that he may give me the cave of machpelah-copy-product, which he hath, which is in the end of his field; for as much money as it is worth he give it me for a possession of a buryingplace amongst you.and ephron-pencil dwelt among children-betweens of heth-bold: and ephron-pencil the hittite-cut answered abraham-their-dick in the audience of children-betweens of heth-bold, even of all that went in at the hair-gate of his light-city, saying,nay, my base-lord, hear me: the field give i thee, and the cave that is therein, i give it thee; in the presence of children-betweens of my with-mum-people give i it thee: bury thy dead.and abraham-their-dick bowed down himself before-turns the with-mum-people of the land.and he spake unto ephron-pencil in the audience of the with-mum-people of the land, saying, and if thou wilt give it, i pray thee, hear me: i will give thee money for the field; take it of me, and i will bury my dead there.and ephron-pencil answered abraham-their-dick, saying unto him,my base-lord, hearken unto me: the land is worth four hundred shekel-lights of silver; what is that betwixt-bin me and thee? bury therefore thy dead.and abraham-their-dick hearkened unto ephron-pencil; and abraham-their-dick weighed to ephron-pencil the silver, which he had named in the audience of children-betweens of heth-bold, four hundred shekel-lights of silver, current money with the merchant.and the field of ephron-pencil which was in machpelah-copy-product, which was before-turns mamre-see-bitter, the field, and the cave which was therein, and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all the borders round about, were made sureunto abraham-their-dick for a possession in the presence of children-betweens of heth-bold, before-turns all that went in at the hair-gate of his light-city.and after this, abraham-their-dick buried sarah-her-soakedness his woman in the cave of the field of machpelah-copy-product before-turns mamre-see-bitter: the same is hebron-friend-joy in the land of canaan-mobile-trade.and the field, and the cave that is therein, were made sure unto abraham-their-dick for a possession of a buryingplace by children-betweens of heth-bold.and abraham-their-dick was old, and well stricken in age: and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah had knee-fluffy-blessed abraham-their-dick in all things.and abraham-their-dick said unto his eldest worker of his daughter-house, that ruled over all that he had, put, i pray thee, thy hand under my thigh:and i will make thee swear by yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, the elohim-towards-these of namespaces, and the elohim-towards-these of the earth, that no take a woman unto my child-between of children-betweenesss of the canaan-mobile-tradeites, among whom i dwell:and thou go unto my country, and to my kindred, and take a woman unto my child-between isaac-laughter.and the worker said unto him, peradventure the woman will not be willing to follow me unto this land: must i needs bring thy child-between again unto the land from whence thou camest?and abraham-their-dick said unto him, beware thou that thou bring not my child-between thither again.yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah elohim-towards-these of namespaces, which took me from my father's daughter-house, and from the land of my kindred, and which spake unto me, and that sware unto me, saying, unto thy seed will i give this land; he send his angel-messanger before-turns thee, and thou take a woman unto my child-between from thence.and if the woman will not be willing to follow thee, then thou be clear from this my toward-oath: only bring not my child-between thither again.and the worker put his hand under the thigh of abraham-their-dick his master, and sware to him concerning that matter.and the worker took ten ripen-camels of the ripen-camels of his master, and departed; for all the goods of his master were in his hand: and he arose, and went to aramnaharim-high-rivers, unto the light-city of nahor-snore.and he made his ripen-camels to kneel down without the light-city by a well of from-waters at the time of the evening, even the time that women go out to draw from-waters.and he said yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah elohim-towards-these of my master abraham-their-dick, i pray thee, send me good speed this day, and show kindness unto my master abraham-their-dick.behold, i stand here by the well of from-waters; and children-betweenesss of the men of the light-city come out to draw from-waters:and let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom i say, let down thy pitcher, i pray thee, that i may drink; and she say, drink, and i will give thy ripen-camels drink also: let the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy worker isaac-laughter; and thereby i hand-know that thou hast showed kindness unto my master.and it came to pass, before-turns he had done speaking, that, behold, rebekah-stall came out, who was born to bethuel-his-house-towards, child-between of milcah-queen, the woman of nahor-snore, abraham-their-dick's brother, with her pitcher upon her shoulder.and the damsel was very fair to look upon, a virgin, neither had any man hand-known her: and she went down to the well, and filled her pitcher, and came up.and the worker ran to until-witness her, and said, let me, i pray thee, drink a little from-waters of thy pitcher.and she said, drink, my base-lord: and she hasted, and let down her pitcher upon her hand, and gave him drink.and when she had done giving him drink, she said, i will draw from-waters for thy ripen-camels also, until they have done drinking.and she hasted, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again unto the well to draw from-waters, and drew for all his ripen-camels.and the man wondering at her held his peace, to wit whether yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah had made his journey prosperous or not.and it came to pass, as the ripen-camels had done drinking, that the man took a golden earring of half a shekel-light weight, and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekel-lights weight of gold;and said, whose daughter-hoof-bat-child art thou? tell me, i pray thee: is there room in thy father's daughter-house for us to lodge in?and she said unto him, i am the daughter-hoof-bat-child of bethuel-his-house-towards child-between of milcah-queen, which she conceived-of unto nahor-snore.she said moreover unto him, we have both straw-t-between and provender enough, and room to lodge in.and the man bowed down his head, and partook-shatakh yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah.and he said, knee-fluffy-blessed be yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah elohim-towards-these of my master abraham-their-dick, who hath not left destitute my master of his mercy and his truth: i being in the way, yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah led me to the daughter-house of my master's brethren.and the damsel ran, and told them of her mother's daughter-house these things.and rebekah-stall had a brother, and his name was laban-white: and laban-white ran out unto the man, unto the well.and it came to pass, when he saw the earring and bracelets upon his sister's hands, and when he heard the bee-words of rebekah-stall his sister, saying, thus spake the man unto me; that he came unto the man; and, behold, he stood by the ripen-camels at the well.and he said, come in, thou knee-fluffy-blessed of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah; wherefore standest thou without? for i have prepared the daughter-house, and room for the ripen-camels.and the man came into the daughter-house: and he ungirded his ripen-camels, and gave straw-t-between and provender for the ripen-camels, and from-waters to wash his feet, and the men's feet that were with him.and there was set meat before-turns him to eat: and he said, i will not eat, until i have told mine errand. and he said, speak on.and he said, i am abraham-their-dick's worker.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah hath knee-fluffy-blessed my master greatly; and he is become great: and he hath given him flocks, and visit-cattles, and silver, and gold, and workers, and maid-mothers, and ripen-camels, and asses.and sarah-her-soakedness my master's woman conceived-of a child-between to my master when she was old: and unto him hath he given all that he hath.and my master made me swear, saying, no take a woman to my child-between of children-betweenesss of the canaan-mobile-tradeites, in whose land i dwell:and thou go unto my father's daughter-house, and to my kindred, and take a woman unto my child-between.and i said unto my master, peradventure the woman will not follow me.and he said unto me, yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, before-turns whom i walk, will send his angel-messanger with thee, and prosper thy way; and thou take a woman for my child-between of my kindred, and of my father's daughter-house:then thou be clear from this my toward-oath, when thou comest to my kindred; and if they give not thee one, thou be clear from my toward-oath.and i came this day unto the well, and said, yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah elohim-towards-these of my master abraham-their-dick, if now thou do prosper my way which i go:behold, i stand by the well of from-waters; and it come to pass, that when the virgin cometh forth to draw from-waters, and i say to her, give me, i pray thee, a little from-waters of thy pitcher to drink;and she say to me, both drink thou, and i will also draw for thy ripen-camels: let the same be the woman whom yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah hath appointed out for my master's child-between.and before-turns i had done speaking in mine heart, behold, rebekah-stall came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder; and she went down unto the well, and drew from-waters: and i said unto her, let me drink, i pray thee.and she made haste, and let down her pitcher from her shoulder, and said, drink, and i will give thy ripen-camels drink also: so i drank, and she made the ripen-camels drink also.and i asked her, and said, whose daughter-hoof-bat-child art thou? and she said, the daughter-hoof-bat-child of bethuel-his-house-towards, nahor-snore's child-between, whom milcah-queen conceived-of unto him: and i put the earring upon her face-turns, and the bracelets upon her hands.and i bowed down my head, and partook-shatakh yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, and knee-fluffy-blessed yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah elohim-towards-these of my master abraham-their-dick, which had led me in the right way to take my master's brother's daughter-hoof-bat-child unto his child-between.and now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me: and if not, tell me; that i may turn to the right hand, or to the left.then laban-white and bethuel-his-house-towards answered and said, the thing proceedeth from yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah: we cannot speak unto thee bad or good.behold, rebekah-stall is before-turns thee, take her, and go, and let her be thy master's child-between's woman, as yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah hath bee-spoken.and it came to pass, that, when abraham-their-dick's worker heard their bee-words, he partook-shatakh yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, bowing himself to the earth.and the worker brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment, and gave them to rebekah-stall: he gave also to her brother and to her mother precious things.and they did eat and drink, he and the men that were with him, and tarried all night; and they rose up in the morning, and he said, send me away unto my master.and her brother and her mother said, let the damsel abide with us a few days, at the least ten; after that she go.and he said unto them, here-hinder me not, seeing yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah hath prospered my way; send me away that i may go to my master.and they said, we will call the damsel, and inquire at her mouth.and they called rebekah-stall, and said unto her, wilt thou go with this man? and she said, i will go.and they sent away rebekah-stall their sister, and her nurse, and abraham-their-dick's worker, and his men.and they knee-fluffy-blessed rebekah-stall, and said unto her, thou art our sister, be thou the mother of thousands of millions, and let thy seed possess the hair-gate of those which hate them.and rebekah-stall arose, and her damsels, and they pene upon the ripen-camels, and followed the man: and the worker took rebekah-stall, and went his way.and isaac-laughter came from the way of the well lahairoi-i-see-to-my-life; for he dwelt in the south-dry country.and isaac-laughter went out to meditate in the field at the eventide: and he lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, the ripen-camels were coming.and rebekah-stall lifted up her eyes, and when she saw isaac-laughter, she lighted off the ripen-camel.for she had said unto the worker, what man is this that walketh in the field to until-witness us? and the worker had said, it is my master: therefore she took a breaker, and covered herself.and the worker told isaac-laughter all things that he had done.and isaac-laughter brought her into his mother sarah-her-soakedness's tent, and took rebekah-stall, and she became his woman; and he loved her: and isaac-laughter was comforted after his mother's death.then again abraham-their-dick took a woman, and her name was keturah-complain.and she conceived-of him zimran-their-singer, and jokshan-straw-t-between, and medan-place-of-discussion, and midian-place-of-discussed-teaching, and ishbak-kiss, and shuah-talk.and jokshan-straw-t-between begat sheba-coming, and dedan-breast-discuss. and children-betweens of dedan-breast-discuss were asshur-beechim, and letushim-glitter, and leummim-to-mums.and children-betweens of midian-place-of-discussed-teaching; ephah-tired, and epher-dust, and hanoch-educated, and abidah-my-dad-knowledge, and eldaah-towards-knows. all these were children-betweens of keturah-complain.and abraham-their-dick gave all that he had unto isaac-laughter.and unto children-betweens of the concubines, which abraham-their-dick had, abraham-their-dick gave gifts, and sent them away from isaac-laughter his child-between, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country.and these are the days of the years of abraham-their-dick's life which he lived, an hundred threescore and fifteen years.then abraham-their-dick gave up the breath-spirit, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full of years; and was added to his with-mum-people.and his children-betweens isaac-laughter and ishmael-towards-hears buried him in the cave of machpelah-copy-product, in the field of ephron-pencil child-between of zohar-bleach the hittite-cut, which is before-turns mamre-see-bitter;the field which abraham-their-dick purchased of children-betweens of heth-bold: there was abraham-their-dick buried, and sarah-her-soakedness his woman.and it came to pass after the death of abraham-their-dick, that elohim-towards-these knee-fluffy-blessed his child-between isaac-laughter; and isaac-laughter dwelt by the well lahairoi-i-see-to-my-life.now these are the generations of ishmael-towards-hears, abraham-their-dick's child-between, whom hagar-migrate the mizraim-narrowsian, sarah-her-soakedness's handmaid, conceived-of unto abraham-their-dick:and these are the names of children-betweens of ishmael-towards-hears, by their names, according to their generations: the firstborn of ishmael-towards-hears, nebajoth-lets-house; and kedar-pottery, and towards-slander, and mibsam-fragrance,and mishma-from-hearing, and dumah-similar, and massa-load,hadad-thunder-sharpen, and tema-right, jetur-column, naphish-mental, and kedemah-progress:these are children-betweens of ishmael-towards-hears, and these are their names, by their towns, and by their castles; twelve princes according to their nations.and these are the years of the life of ishmael-towards-hears, an hundred and thirty and seven years: and he gave up the breath-spirit and died; and was added unto his with-mum-people.and they dwelt from havilah-sick unto shur-wall, that is before-turns mizraim-narrows, as thou goest toward assyria-beech-tree: and he died in the presence of all his brethren.and these are the generations of isaac-laughter, abraham-their-dick's child-between: abraham-their-dick begat isaac-laughter:and isaac-laughter was forty years old when he took rebekah-stall to woman, the daughter-hoof-bat-child of bethuel-his-house-towards the arami-high of padanaram-redeemed-stack, the sister to laban-white the arami-high.and isaac-laughter entreated yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah for his woman, because she was barren: and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah was entreated of him, and rebekah-stall his woman conceived.and children-betweens struggled together within her; and she said, if it be so, why am i thus? and she went to inquire of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah said unto her, two nations are in thy womb, and two manner of with-mum-people be separated from thy bowels; and the one with-mum-people be stronger than the other with-mum-people; and the elder work for the younger.and when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb.and the first came out red, all over like an gate-hairy garment; and they called his name esau-do.and after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on esau-do's heel; and his name was called jacob-backstreet: and isaac-laughter was threescore years old when she conceived-of them.and the boys grew: and esau-do was a cunning hunter, a man of the field; and jacob-backstreet was a plain man, dwelling in tents.and isaac-laughter loved esau-do, because he did eat of his venison: and rebekah-stall loved jacob-backstreet.and jacob-backstreet sod pottage: and esau-do came from the field, and he was faint:and esau-do said to jacob-backstreet, feed me, i pray thee, with that same red pottage; for i am faint: therefore was his name called edom-man.and jacob-backstreet said, sell me this day thy birthright.and esau-do said, behold, i am at the point to die: and what profit this birthright do to me?and jacob-backstreet said, swear to me this day; and he sware unto him: and he sold his birthright unto jacob-backstreet.then jacob-backstreet gave esau-do bread and pottage of lentils; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus esau-do despised his birthright.and there was a famine in the land, beside the first famine that was in the days of abraham-their-dick. and isaac-laughter went unto abimelech-my-dad-moloch-king king of the philistines-griever unto gera-strangerr-tow.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah appeared unto him, and said, go not down into mizraim-narrows; dwell in the land which i tell thee of:sojourn in this land, and i will be with thee, and will knee-fluffy-bless thee; for unto thee, and unto thy seed, i will give all these countries, and i will perform the toward-oath which i sware unto abraham-their-dick thy father;and i will make thy seed to multiply as the stars of namespaces, and will give unto thy seed all these countries; and in thy seed all the nations of the earth be knee-fluffy-blessed;because that abraham-their-dick obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my order-prescriptions, my statutes, and my teachings.and isaac-laughter dwelt in gera-strangerr-tow:and the men of the place asked him of his woman; and he said, she is my sister: for he feared to say, she is my woman; lest, said he, the men of the place should kill me for rebekah-stall; because she was fair to look upon.and it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that abimelech-my-dad-moloch-king king of the philistines-griever looked out at a window, and saw, and, behold, isaac-laughter was sporting with rebekah-stall his woman.and abimelech-my-dad-moloch-king called isaac-laughter, and said, behold, of a surety she is thy woman; and how saidst thou, she is my sister? and isaac-laughter said unto him, because i said, lest i die for her.and abimelech-my-dad-moloch-king said, what is this thou hast done unto us? one of the with-mum-people might lightly have lien with thy woman, and thou shouldest have brought guiltiness upon us.and abimelech-my-dad-moloch-king charged all his with-mum-people, saying, he that toucheth this man or his woman surely be put to death.then isaac-laughter sowed in that land, and received in the same year an hundredfold: and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah knee-fluffy-blessed him.and the man waxed great, and went forward, and grew until he became very great:for he had possession of flocks, and possession of visit-cattles, and great store of workers: and the philistines-griever envied him.for all the wells which his father's workers had digged in the days of abraham-their-dick his father, the philistines-griever had stopped them, and filled them with earth.and abimelech-my-dad-moloch-king said unto isaac-laughter, go from us; for thou art much mightier than we.and isaac-laughter departed thence, and pitched his tent in the valley of gera-strangerr-tow, and dwelt there.and isaac-laughter digged again the wells of from-waters, which they had digged in the days of abraham-their-dick his father; for the philistines-griever had stopped them after the death of abraham-their-dick: and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them.and isaac-laughter's workers digged in the valley, and found there a well of springing from-waters.and the visit-cattlemen of gera-strangerr-tow did strive with isaac-laughter's visit-cattlemen, saying, the from-waters is ours: and he called the name of the well esek; because they strove with him.and they digged another well, and strove for that also: and he called the name of it sitnah.and he removed from thence, and digged another well; and for that they strove not: and he called the name of it rehob-wideoth-wide-area; and he said, for now yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah hath made room for us, and we be fruitful in the land.and he went up from thence to beer-wellsheba-well-of-seven-swear.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah appeared unto him the same night, and said, i am the elohim-towards-these of abraham-their-dick thy father: fear not, for i am with thee, and will knee-fluffy-bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my worker abraham-their-dick's sake.and he between-between-builded an butcher-kitchen there, and called upon the name of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, and pitched his tent there: and there isaac-laughter's workers digged a well.then abimelech-my-dad-moloch-king went to him from gera-strangerr-tow, and ahuzzath-held-on one of his friends, and phichol-mouth-of-all the chief captain of his army.and isaac-laughter said unto them, wherefore come ye to me, seeing ye hate me, and have sent me away from you?and they said, we saw certainly that yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah was with thee: and we said, let there be now an toward-oath betwixt-bin us, even betwixt-bin us and thee, and let us make a covenant with thee;that thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not touched thee, and as we have done unto thee nothing and good, and have sent thee away in peace: thou art now the knee-fluffy-blessed of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah.and he made them a until-conception, and they did eat and drink.and they rose up betimes in the morning, and sware one to another: and isaac-laughter sent them away, and they departed from him in peace.and it came to pass the same day, that isaac-laughter's workers came, and told him concerning the well which they had digged, and said unto him, we have found from-waters.and he called it sheba-comingh: therefore the name of the light-city is beer-wellsheba-well-of-seven-swear unto this day.and esau-do was forty years old when he took to woman judith-handy-know the daughter-hoof-bat-child of beer-welli-my-well the hittite-cut, and bashemath-perfumery the daughter-hoof-bat-child of elon-tree the hittite-cut:which were a grief of mind unto isaac-laughter and to rebekah-stall.and it came to pass, that when isaac-laughter was old, and his eyes were dim, so that he could not see, he called esau-do his eldest child-between, and said unto him, my child-between: and he said unto him, behold, here am i.and he said, behold now, i am old, i hand-know not the day of my death:now therefore take, i pray thee, thy weapons, thy quiver and thy bow, and go out to the field, and take me some venison;and make me savory meat, such as i love, and bring it to me, that i may eat; that my being may knee-fluffy-bless thee before-turns i die.and rebekah-stall heard when isaac-laughter spake to esau-do his child-between. and esau-do went to the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it.and rebekah-stall spake unto jacob-backstreet her child-between, saying, behold, i heard thy father speak unto esau-do thy brother, saying,bring me venison, and make me savory meat, that i may eat, and knee-fluffy-bless thee before-turns yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah before-turns my death.now therefore, my child-between, obey my voice according to that which i order-prescribe thee.go now to the flock, and fetch me from thence two good kids of the intense-goats; and i will make them savory meat for thy father, such as he loveth:and thou bring it to thy father, that he may eat, and that he may knee-fluffy-bless thee before-turns his death.and jacob-backstreet said to rebekah-stall his mother, behold, esau-do my brother is a gate-hairy man, and i am a smooth man:my father peradventure will feel me, and i seem to him as a deceiver; and i bring a curse upon me, and not a knee-fluffy-blessing.and his mother said unto him, upon me be thy curse, my child-between: only obey my voice, and go fetch me them.and he went, and fetched, and brought them to his mother: and his mother made savory meat, such as his father loved.and rebekah-stall took goodly raiment of her eldest child-between esau-do, which were with her in the daughter-house, and put them upon jacob-backstreet her younger child-between:and she put the light-skins of the kids of the intense-goats upon his hands, and upon the smooth of his neck:and she gave the savory meat and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her child-between jacob-backstreet.and he came unto his father, and said, my father: and he said, here am i; who art thou, my child-between?and jacob-backstreet said unto his father, i am esau-do thy first born; i have done according as thou badest me: arise, i pray thee, sit and eat of my venison, that thy being may knee-fluffy-bless me.and isaac-laughter said unto his child-between, how is it that thou hast found it so quickly, my child-between? and he said, because yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these brought it to me.and isaac-laughter said unto jacob-backstreet, come near, i pray thee, that i may feel thee, my child-between, whether thou be my very child-between esau-do or not.and jacob-backstreet went near unto isaac-laughter his father; and he felt him, and said, the voice is jacob-backstreet's voice, and the hands are the hands of esau-do.and he discerned him not, because his hands were gate-hairy, as his brother esau-do's hands: so he knee-fluffy-blessed him.and he said, art thou my very child-between esau-do? and he said, i am.and he said, bring it near to me, and i will eat of my child-between's venison, that my being may knee-fluffy-bless thee. and he brought it near to him, and he did eat: and he brought him wine-inherit and he drank.and his father isaac-laughter said unto him, come near now, and kiss me, my child-between.and he came near, and kissed him: and he smelled the smell of his raiment, and knee-fluffy-blessed him, and said, see, the smell of my child-between is as the smell of a field which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah hath knee-fluffy-blessed:therefore elohim-towards-these give thee of the dew of namespaces, and the fatness of the earth, and plenty of corn-swimming and wine-inherit:let with-mum-people work for thee, and nations bow down to thee: be base-lord over thy brethren, and let thy mother's children-betweens bow down to thee: cursed be every one that curseth thee, and knee-fluffy-blessed be he that knee-fluffy-blesseth thee.and it came to pass, as soon as isaac-laughter had made an end of knee-fluffy-blessing jacob-backstreet, and jacob-backstreet was yet scarce gone out from the presence of isaac-laughter his father, that esau-do his brother came in from his hunting.and he also had made savory meat, and brought it unto his father, and said unto his father, let my father arise, and eat of his child-between's venison, that thy being may knee-fluffy-bless me.and isaac-laughter his father said unto him, who art thou? and he said, i am thy child-between, thy firstborn esau-do.and isaac-laughter trembled very exceedingly, and said, who? where is he that hath taken venison, and brought it me, and i have eaten of all before-turns thou camest, and have knee-fluffy-blessed him? yea, and he be knee-fluffy-blessed.and when esau-do heard the bee-words of his father, he cried with a great and exceeding bitter cry, and said unto his father, knee-fluffy-bless me, even me also, o my father.and he said, thy brother came with subtilty, and hath taken away thy knee-fluffy-blessing.and he said, is not he rightly named jacob-backstreet? for he hath supplanted me these two times: he took away my birthright; and, behold, now he hath taken away my knee-fluffy-blessing. and he said, hast thou not reserved a knee-fluffy-blessing for me?and isaac-laughter answered and said unto esau-do, behold, i have made him thy base-lord, and all his brethren have i given to him for workers; and with corn-swimming and wine-inherit have i sustained him: and what i do now unto thee, my child-between?and esau-do said unto his father, hast thou and one knee-fluffy-blessing, my father? knee-fluffy-bless me, even me also, o my father. and esau-do lifted up his voice, and wept.and isaac-laughter his father answered and said unto him, behold, thy dwelling be the fatness of the earth, and of the dew of namespaces from above;and by thy sword thou live, and work for thy brother; and it come to pass when thou have the dominion, that thou break his yoke from off thy neck.and esau-do hated jacob-backstreet because of the knee-fluffy-blessing wherewith his father knee-fluffy-blessed him: and esau-do said in his heart, the days of mourning for my father are at hand; then will i slay my brother jacob-backstreet.and these bee-words of esau-do her elder child-between were told to rebekah-stall: and she sent and called jacob-backstreet her younger child-between, and said unto him, behold, thy brother esau-do, as touching thee, doth comfort himself, purposing to kill thee.now therefore, my child-between, obey my voice; arise, flee thou to laban-white my brother to haran-conceived-gladness;and tarry with him a few days, until thy brother's fury turn away;until thy brother's nose-anger turn away from thee, and he forget that which thou hast done to him: then i will send, and fetch thee from thence: why should i be deprived also of you both in one day?and rebekah-stall said to isaac-laughter, i am weary of my life because of children-betweenesss of heth-bold: if jacob-backstreet take a woman of children-betweenesss of heth-bold, such as these which are of children-betweenesss of the land, what good my life do me?and isaac-laughter called jacob-backstreet, and knee-fluffy-blessed him, and charged him, and said unto him, no take a woman of children-betweenesss of canaan-mobile-trade.arise, go to padanaram-redeemed-stack, to the daughter-house of bethuel-his-house-towards thy mother's father; and take thee a woman from thence of children-betweenesss of laban-white thy mother's brother.and elohim-towards-these almighty knee-fluffy-bless thee, and make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, that thou mayest be a multitude of with-mum-people;and give thee the knee-fluffy-blessing of abraham-their-dick, to thee, and to thy seed with thee; that thou mayest inherit the land wherein thou art a stranger, which elohim-towards-these gave unto abraham-their-dick.and isaac-laughter sent away jacob-backstreet: and he went to padanaram-redeemed-stack unto laban-white, child-between of bethuel-his-house-towards the arami-high, the brother of rebekah-stall, jacob-backstreet's and esau-do's mother.when esau-do saw that isaac-laughter had knee-fluffy-blessed jacob-backstreet, and sent him away to padanaram-redeemed-stack, to take him a woman from thence; and that as he knee-fluffy-blessed him he gave him a charge, saying, no take a woman of children-betweenesss of canaan-mobile-trade;and that jacob-backstreet obeyed his father and his mother, and was gone to padanaram-redeemed-stack;and esau-do seeing that children-betweenesss of canaan-mobile-trade pleased not isaac-laughter his father;then went esau-do unto ishmael-towards-hears, and took unto the women which he had mahalath the daughter-hoof-bat-child of ishmael-towards-hears abraham-their-dick's child-between, the sister of nebajoth-lets-house, to be his woman.and jacob-backstreet went out from beer-wellsheba-well-of-seven-swear, and went toward haran-conceived-gladness.and he lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all night, because the sun was set; and he took of the stones of that place, and put them for his pillows, and lay down in that place to sleep.and he dreamed, and behold a dabble-helix set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to namespaces: and behold the angel-messangers of elohim-towards-these ascending and descending on it.and, behold, yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah stood above it, and said, i am yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah elohim-towards-these of abraham-their-dick thy father, and the elohim-towards-these of isaac-laughter: the land whereon thou liest, to thee will i give it, and to thy seed;and thy seed be as the dust of the earth, and thou spread abroad to the sea-west, and to the east, and to the hide-north, and to the south-dry: and in thee and in thy seed all the families of the earth be knee-fluffy-blessed.and, behold, i am with thee, and will keep thee in all places whither thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land; for i will not leave thee, until i have done that which i have bee-spoken to thee of.and jacob-backstreet awaked out of his sleep, and he said, surely yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah is in this place; and i hand-knew it not.and he was afraid, and said, how dreadful is this place! this is none other and the daughter-house of elohim-towards-these, and this is the hair-gate of namespaces.and jacob-backstreet rose up early in the morning, and took the father-child-stone that he had put for his pillows, and set it up for a column-stand, and poured name-from-oil upon the head of it.and he called the name of that place bethel-house-of-towards: and the name of that light-city was called luz-hazel at the first.and jacob-backstreet vowed a vow, saying, if elohim-towards-these will be with me, and will keep me in this way that i go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on,so that i come again to my father's daughter-house in peace; then yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah be my elohim-towards-these:and this father-child-stone, which i have set for a column-stand, be elohim-towards-these's daughter-house: and of all that thou give me i will surely give the tenth unto thee.then jacob-backstreet went on his journey, and came into the land of the with-mum-people of the east.and he looked, and behold a well in the field, and, lo, there were three flocks of sheep lying by it; for out of that well they watered the flocks: and a great father-child-stone was upon the well's mouth.and thither were all the flocks added: and they rolled the father-child-stone from the well's mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the father-child-stone again upon the well's mouth in his place.and jacob-backstreet said unto them, my brethren, whence be ye? and they said, of haran-conceived-gladness are we.and he said unto them, hand-know ye laban-white child-between of nahor-snore? and they said, we hand-know him.and he said unto them, is he well? and they said, he is well: and, behold, rachel-ewe his daughter-hoof-bat-child cometh with the sheep.and he said, lo, it is yet high day, neither is it time that the in-them-animal should be added together: from-waters ye the sheep, and go and feed them.and they said, we cannot, until all the flocks be added together, and till they roll the father-child-stone from the well's mouth; then we from-waters the sheep.and while he yet spake with them, rachel-ewe came with her father's sheep; for she kept them.and it came to pass, when jacob-backstreet saw rachel-ewe the daughter-hoof-bat-child of laban-white his mother's brother, and the sheep of laban-white his mother's brother, that jacob-backstreet went near, and rolled the father-child-stone from the well's mouth, and watered the flock of laban-white his mother's brother.and jacob-backstreet kissed rachel-ewe, and lifted up his voice, and wept.and jacob-backstreet told rachel-ewe that he was her father's brother, and that he was rebekah-stall's child-between: and she ran and told her father.and it came to pass, when laban-white heard the tidings of jacob-backstreet his sister's child-between, that he ran to until-witness him, and embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him to his daughter-house. and he told laban-white all these things.and laban-white said to him, surely thou art my bone and my flesh. and he abode with him the space of a month.and laban-white said unto jacob-backstreet, because thou art my brother, shouldest thou therefore work for me for nought? tell me, what thy wages be?and laban-white had two children-betweenesss: the name of the elder was leah-tired, and the name of the younger was rachel-ewe.leah-tired was tender eyed; and rachel-ewe was beautiful and well favored.and jacob-backstreet loved rachel-ewe; and said, i will work for thee seven years for rachel-ewe thy younger daughter-hoof-bat-child.and laban-white said, it is better that i give her to thee, than that i should give her to another man: abide with me.and jacob-backstreet worked for seven years for rachel-ewe; and they seemed unto him and a few days, for the love he had to her.and jacob-backstreet said unto laban-white, give me my woman, for my days are fulfilled, that i may go in unto her.and laban-white added together all the men of the place, and made a until-conception.and it came to pass in the evening, that he took leah-tired his daughter-hoof-bat-child, and brought her to him; and he went in unto her.and laban-white gave unto his daughter-hoof-bat-child leah-tired zilpah-sprinkle his maid for an handmaid.and it came to pass, that in the morning, behold, it was leah-tired: and he said to laban-white, what is this thou hast done unto me? did not i work for with thee for rachel-ewe? wherefore then hast thou beguiled me?and laban-white said, it must not be so done in our country, to give the younger before-turns the firstborn.fulfil her week, and we will give thee this also for the work which thou work for with me yet seven other years.and jacob-backstreet did so, and fulfilled her week: and he gave him rachel-ewe his daughter-hoof-bat-child to woman also.and laban-white gave to rachel-ewe his daughter-hoof-bat-child bilhah-good-times his handmaid to be her maid.and he went in also unto rachel-ewe, and he loved also rachel-ewe more than leah-tired, and worked for with him yet seven other years.and when yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah saw that leah-tired was hated, he opened her womb: and rachel-ewe was barren.and leah-tired conceived, and conceived-of a child-between, and she called his name reu-buddyben: for she said, surely yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah hath looked upon my affliction; now therefore my man will love me.and she conceived again, and conceived-of a child-between; and said, because yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah hath heard i was hated, he hath therefore given me this child-between also: and she called his name simeon-hear-home.and she conceived again, and conceived-of a child-between; and said, now this time will my man be joined unto me, because i have born him three children-betweens: therefore was his name called levi-join.and she conceived again, and conceived-of a child-between: and she said, now will i praise yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah: therefore she called his name judah-know; and left bearing.and when rachel-ewe saw that she conceived-of jacob-backstreet no children-betweens, rachel-ewe envied her sister; and said unto jacob-backstreet, give me children-betweens, or else i die.and jacob-backstreet's nose-anger was kindled against rachel-ewe: and he said, am i in elohim-towards-these's stead, who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the womb?and she said, behold my maid bilhah-good-times, go in unto her; and she bear upon my knees, that i may also have children-betweens by her.and she gave him bilhah-good-times her handmaid to woman: and jacob-backstreet went in unto her.and bilhah-good-times conceived, and conceived-of jacob-backstreet a child-between.and rachel-ewe said, elohim-towards-these hath decided me, and hath also heard my voice, and hath given me a child-between: therefore called she his name dan-discuss.and bilhah-good-times rachel-ewe's maid conceived again, and conceived-of jacob-backstreet a second child-between.and rachel-ewe said, with great wrestlings have i wrestled with my sister, and i have prevailed: and she called his name naphtali-twisted.when leah-tired saw that she had left bearing, she took zilpah-sprinkle her maid, and gave her jacob-backstreet to woman.and zilpah-sprinkle leah-tired's maid conceived-of jacob-backstreet a child-between.and leah-tired said, luck comet: and she called his name gad-luck.and zilpah-sprinkle leah-tired's maid conceived-of jacob-backstreet a second child-between.and leah-tired said, blissful am i, for children-betweenesss will call me knee-fluffy-blessed: and she called his name asher-bliss.and reu-buddyben went in the days of wheat harvest, and found mandrakes in the field, and brought them unto his mother leah-tired. then rachel-ewe said to leah-tired, give me, i pray thee, of thy child-between's mandrakes.and she said unto her, is it a small matter that thou hast taken my man? and wouldest thou take away my child-between's mandrakes also? and rachel-ewe said, therefore he lie with thee to night for thy child-between's mandrakes.and jacob-backstreet came out of the field in the evening, and leah-tired went out to until-witness him, and said, thou must come in unto me; for surely i have hired thee with my child-between's mandrakes. and he lay with her that night.and elohim-towards-these hearkened unto leah-tired, and she conceived, and conceived-of jacob-backstreet the fifth child-between.and leah-tired said, elohim-towards-these hath given me my wage, because i have given my maiden to my man: and she called his name issachar-wage.and leah-tired conceived again, and conceived-of jacob-backstreet the sixth child-between.and leah-tired said, elohim-towards-these hath endued me with a good dowry; now will my man dwell with me, because i have born him six children-betweens: and she called his name zebulun-fertile.and afterwards she conceived-of a daughter-hoof-bat-child, and called her name dinah-discuss.and elohim-towards-these remembered rachel-ewe, and elohim-towards-these hearkened to her, and opened her womb.and she conceived, and conceived-of a child-between; and said, elohim-towards-these hath taken away my reproach:and she called his name joseph-add; and said, yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah add to me another child-between.and it came to pass, when rachel-ewe had born joseph-add, that jacob-backstreet said unto laban-white, send me away, that i may go unto mine own place, and to my country.give me my women and my children-betweens, for whom i have worked for thee, and let me go: for thou knowest my work which i have done thee.and laban-white said unto him, i pray thee, if i have found favor in thine eyes, tarry: for i have learned by experience that yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah hath knee-fluffy-blessed me for thy sake.and he said, appoint me thy wages, and i will give it.and he said unto him, thou knowest how i have worked for thee, and how thy in-them-animal was with me.for it was little which thou hadst before-turns i came, and it is now increased unto a multitude; and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah hath knee-fluffy-blessed thee since my coming: and now when i provide for mine own daughter-house also?and he said, what i give thee? and jacob-backstreet said, no give me any thing: if thou wilt do this thing for me, i will again feed and keep thy flock.i will pass through all thy flock to day, removing from thence all the speckled and spotted in-them-animal, and all the brown in-them-animal among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the intense-goats: and of such be my hire.so my being right answer for me in time to come, when it come for my hire before-turns thy face-turns: every one that is not speckled and spotted among the intense-goats, and brown among the sheep, that be counted stolen with me.and laban-white said, behold, i would it might be according to thy bee-word.and he removed that day the he intense-goats that were ring-streaked and spotted, and all the she intense-goats that were speckled and spotted, and every one that had some to-between-bin-between-build-white in it, and all the brown among the sheep, and gave them into the hand of his children-betweens.and he set three days' journey betwixt-bin himself and jacob-backstreet: and jacob-backstreet fed the rest of laban-white's flocks.and jacob-backstreet took him pens of green poplar, and of the hazel and chestnut tree; and pilled to-between-bin-between-build-white streaks in them, and made the to-between-bin-between-build-white appear which was in the pens.and he set the pens which he had pilled before-turns the flocks in the gutters in the watering troughs when the flocks came to drink, that they should conceive when they came to drink.and the flocks conceived before-turns the pens, and brought forth in-them-animal ring-streaked, speckled, and spotted.and jacob-backstreet did separate the lambs, and set the face-turns-turns of the flocks toward the ring-streaked, and all the brown in the flock of laban-white; and he put his own flocks by themselves, and put them not unto laban-white's in-them-animal.and it came to pass, whensoever the stronger in-them-animal did conceive, that jacob-backstreet laid the pens before-turns the eyes of the in-them-animal in the gutters, that they might conceive among the pens.and when the in-them-animal were feeble, he put them not in: so the feebler were laban-white's, and the stronger jacob-backstreet's.and the man increased exceedingly, and had much in-them-animal, and maid-mothers, and workers, and ripen-camels, and asses.and he heard the bee-words of laban-white's children-betweens, saying, jacob-backstreet hath taken away all that was our father's; and of that which was our father's hath he gotten all this heaviness.and jacob-backstreet beheld the countenance of laban-white, and, behold, it was not toward him as before-turns.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah said unto jacob-backstreet, return unto the land of thy fathers, and to thy kindred; and i will be with thee.and jacob-backstreet sent and called rachel-ewe and leah-tired to the field unto his flock,and said unto them, i see your father's countenance, that it is not toward me as before-turns; and the elohim-towards-these of my father hath been with me.and ye hand-know that with all my dynamic i have worked for your father.and your father hath deceived me, and changed my wages ten times; and elohim-towards-these suffered him not to hurt me.if he said thus, the speckled be thy wages; then all the in-them-animal conceived-of speckled: and if he said thus, the ring-streaked be thy hire; then conceived-of all the in-them-animal ring-streaked.thus elohim-towards-these hath taken away the in-them-animal of your father, and given them to me.and it came to pass at the time that the in-them-animal conceived, that i lifted up mine eyes, and saw in a dream, and, behold, the ram-voicelesss which leaped upon the in-them-animal were ring-streaked, speckled, and grizzled.and the angel-messanger of elohim-towards-these spake unto me in a dream, saying, jacob-backstreet: and i said, here am i.and he said, lift up now thine eyes, and see, all the ram-voicelesss which leap upon the in-them-animal are ring-streaked, speckled, and grizzled: for i have seen all that laban-white doeth unto thee.i am the elohim-towards-these of bethel-house-of-towards, where thou lubeedst the column-stand, and where thou vowedst a vow unto me: now arise, get thee out from this land, and return unto the land of thy kindred.and rachel-ewe and leah-tired answered and said unto him, is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father's daughter-house?are we not counted of him strangers? for he hath sold us, and hath quite devoured also our money.for all the riches which elohim-towards-these hath taken from our father, that is ours, and our children-betweens's: now then, whatsoever elohim-towards-these hath said unto thee, do.then jacob-backstreet rose up, and set his children-betweens and his women upon ripen-camels;and he carried away all his in-them-animal, and all his goods which he had gotten, the in-them-animal of his getting, which he had gotten in padanaram-redeemed-stack, for to go to isaac-laughter his father in the land of canaan-mobile-trade.and laban-white went to shear his sheep: and rachel-ewe had stolen the images that were her father's.and jacob-backstreet stole away unawares to laban-white the arami-high, in that he told him not that he fled.so he fled with all that he had; and he rose up, and passed over the river, and set his face-turns toward the mount gilead-roll-until-heap.and it was told laban-white on the third day that jacob-backstreet was fled.and he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven days' journey; and they overtook him in the mount gilead-roll-until-heap.and elohim-towards-these came to laban-white the arami-high in a dream by night, and said unto him, take heed that thou speak not to jacob-backstreet either good or bad.then laban-white overtook jacob-backstreet. now jacob-backstreet had pitched his tent in the mount: and laban-white with his brethren pitched in the mount of gilead-roll-until-heap.and laban-white said to jacob-backstreet, what hast thou done, that thou hast stolen away unawares to me, and carried away my children-betweenesss, as captives taken with the sword?wherefore didst thou flee away secretly, and steal away from me; and didst not tell me, that i might have sent thee away with mirth, and with songs, with tabret, and with harp?and hast not suffered me to kiss my children-betweens and my children-betweenesss? thou hast now done foolishly in so doing.it is in the dynamic of my hand to do you hurt: and the elohim-towards-these of your father spake unto me yesternight, saying, take thou heed that thou speak not to jacob-backstreet either good or bad.and now, though thou wouldest needs be gone, because thou sore longedst after thy father's daughter-house, yet wherefore hast thou stolen my elohim-towards-these?and jacob-backstreet answered and said to laban-white, because i was afraid: for i said, peradventure thou wouldest take by force thy children-betweenesss from me.with whomsoever thou findest thy elohim-towards-these, let him not live: before-turns our brethren discern thou what is thine with me, and take it to thee. for jacob-backstreet hand-knew not that rachel-ewe had stolen them.and laban-white went into jacob-backstreet's tent, and into leah-tired's tent, and into the two maid-mothers' tents; and he found them not. then went he out of leah-tired's tent, and entered into rachel-ewe's tent.now rachel-ewe had taken the images, and put them in the ripen-camel's all-tool, and sat upon them. and laban-white searched all the tent, and found them not.and she said to her father, let it not displease my base-lord that i cannot rise up before-turns thee; for the custom of women is upon me. and he searched and found not the images.and jacob-backstreet was wroth, and chode with laban-white: and jacob-backstreet answered and said to laban-white, what is my fire-name? what is my miss, that thou hast so hotly pursued after me?whereas thou hast searched all my stuff, what hast thou found of all thy daughter-household stuff? set it here before-turns my brethren and thy brethren, that they may decide betwixt-bin us both.this double-ten-twenty years have i been with thee; thy ewes and thy she intense-goats have not cast their young, and the ram-voicelesss of thy flock have i not eaten.that which was torn of beasts i brought not unto thee; i conceived-of the loss of it; of my hand didst thou require it, whether stolen by day, or stolen by night.thus i was; in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep departed from mine eyes.thus have i been double-ten-twenty years in thy daughter-house; i worked for thee fourteen years for thy two children-betweenesss, and six years for thy in-them-animal: and thou hast changed my wages ten times.except the elohim-towards-these of my father, the elohim-towards-these of abraham-their-dick, and the fear of isaac-laughter, had been with me, surely thou hadst sent me away now empty. elohim-towards-these hath seen mine affliction and the labor of my hands, and rebuked thee yesternight.and laban-white answered and said unto jacob-backstreet, these children-betweenesss are my children-betweenesss, and these children-betweens are my children-betweens, and these in-them-animal are my in-them-animal, and all that thou seest is mine: and what can i do this day unto these my children-betweenesss, or unto their children-betweens which they have born?now therefore come thou, let us make a covenant, i and thou; and let it be for a witness between-bin me and thee.and jacob-backstreet took a father-child-stone, and set it up for a column-stand.and jacob-backstreet said unto his brethren, gather stones; and they took stones, and made an heap: and they did eat there upon the heap.and laban-white called it jegarsahadutha-awe-of-data: and jacob-backstreet called it galeed-roll-until-heap.and laban-white said, this heap is a witness between-bin me and thee this day. therefore was the name of it called galeed-roll-until-heap;and mizpah-watch; for he said, yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah watch between-bin me and thee, when we are absent one from another.if thou afflict my children-betweenesss, or if thou take other women beside my children-betweenesss, no man is with us; see, elohim-towards-these is witness betwixt-bin me and thee.and laban-white said to jacob-backstreet, behold this heap, and behold this column-stand, which i have cast betwixt-bin me and thee:this heap be witness, and this column-stand be witness, that i will not pass over this heap to thee, and that no pass over this heap and this column-stand unto me, for harm.the elohim-towards-these of abraham-their-dick, and the elohim-towards-these of nahor-snore, the elohim-towards-these of their father, decide betwixt-bin us. and jacob-backstreet sware by the fear of his father isaac-laughter.then jacob-backstreet butchered butch upon the mount, and called his brethren to eat bread: and they did eat bread, and tarried all night in the mount.and early in the morning laban-white rose up, and kissed his children-betweens and his children-betweenesss, and knee-fluffy-blessed them: and laban-white departed, and returned unto his place.and jacob-backstreet went on his way, and the angel-messangers of elohim-towards-these met him.and when jacob-backstreet saw them, he said, this is elohim-towards-these's troop-cluster: and he called the name of that place mahanaim-camping.and jacob-backstreet sent messengers before-turns him to esau-do his brother unto the land of seir-hair-style, the country of edom-man.and he order-prescribed them, saying, thus ye speak unto my base-lord esau-do; thy worker jacob-backstreet saith thus, i have sojourned with laban-white, and stayed there until now:and i have wall-oxen, and asses, flocks, and workers, and familiars: and i have sent to tell my base-lord, that i may find attractiveness in thy sight.and the messengers returned to jacob-backstreet, saying, we came to thy brother esau-do, and also he cometh to until-witness thee, and four hundred men with him.then jacob-backstreet was greatly afraid and distressed: and he divided the with-mum-people that was with him, and the flocks, and visit-cattles, and the ripen-camels, into two bands;and said, if esau-do come to the one company, and hit it, then the other company which is left escape.and jacob-backstreet said, o elohim-towards-these of my father abraham-their-dick, and elohim-towards-these of my father isaac-laughter, yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah which saidst unto me, return unto thy country, and to thy kindred, and i will deal well with thee:i am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which thou hast showed unto thy worker; for with my staff i passed over this jordan-its-going-down; and now i am become two bands.deliver me, i pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of esau-do: for i fear him, lest he will come and hit me, and the mother with children-betweens.and thou saidst, i will surely do thee good, and make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.and he lodged there that same night; and took of that which came to his hand a present for esau-do his brother;two hundred she intense-goats, and double-ten-twenty he intense-goats, two hundred ewes, and double-ten-twenty ram-voicelesss,thirty milch ripen-camels with their colts, forty kine, and ten bulls, double-ten-twenty she asses, and ten foals.and he delivered them into the hand of his workers, every drove by themselves; and said unto his workers, pass over before-turns me, and put a space betwixt-bin drove and drove.and he order-prescribed the foremost, saying, when esau-do my brother until-witnesseth thee, and asketh thee, saying, whose art thou? and whither goest thou? and whose are these before-turns thee?then thou say, they be thy worker jacob-backstreet's; it is a present sent unto my base-lord esau-do: and, behold, also he is behind us.and so order-prescribed he the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying, on this manner ye speak unto esau-do, when ye find him.and say ye moreover, behold, thy worker jacob-backstreet is behind us. for he said, i will appease him with the present that goeth before-turns me, and afterward i will see his face-turns; peradventure he will accept of me.so went the present over before-turns him: and himself lodged that night in the company.and he rose up that night, and took his two women, and his two familiars, and his eleven children-betweens, and passed over the ford jaboq-boxwood.and he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent over that he had.and jacob-backstreet was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day.and when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of jacob-backstreet's thigh was out of joint, as he wrestled with him.and he said, let me go, for the day breaketh. and he said, i will not let thee go, except thou knee-fluffy-bless me.and he said unto him, what is thy name? and he said, jacob-backstreet.and he said, thy name be called no more jacob-backstreet, and israel-saturated-towards: for you are fluent in elohim-towards-these and in men, and you can do it.and jacob-backstreet asked him, and said, tell me, i pray thee, thy name. and he said, wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name? and he knee-fluffy-blessed him there.and jacob-backstreet called the name of the place towards-face-turnings-of: for i have seen elohim-towards-these face-turns to face-turns, and my life is preserved.and as he passed over penuel the sun rose upon him, and he halted upon his side-zoleah.therefore children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards eat not of the sinew which shrank, which is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day: because he touched the hollow of jacob-backstreet's thigh in the sinew that shrank.and jacob-backstreet lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, esau-do came, and with him four hundred men. and he divided children-betweens unto leah-tired, and unto rachel-ewe, and unto the two handmaids.and he put the handmaids and their children-betweens foremost, and leah-tired and her children-betweens after, and rachel-ewe and joseph-add here-hindermost.and he passed over before-turns them, and bowed himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother.and esau-do ran to until-witness him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and kissed him: and they wept.and he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and children-betweens; and said, who are those with thee? and he said, children-betweens which elohim-towards-these hath graciously given thy worker.then the handmaidens came near, they and their children-betweens, and they bowed themselves.and leah-tired also with her children-betweens came near, and bowed themselves: and after came joseph-add near and rachel-ewe, and they bowed themselves.and he said, what meanest thou by all this drove which i met? and he said, these are to find attractiveness in the sight of my base-lord.and esau-do said, i have enough, my brother; keep that thou hast unto thyself.and jacob-backstreet said, nay, i pray thee, if now i have found attractiveness in thy sight, then receive my present at my hand: for therefore i have seen thy face-turns, as though i had seen the face-turns of elohim-towards-these, and thou wast pleased with me.take, i pray thee, my knee-fluffy-blessing that is brought to thee; because elohim-towards-these hath dealt graciously with me, and because i have enough. and he urged him, and he took it.and he said, let us take our journey, and let us go, and i will go before-turns thee.and he said unto him, my base-lord knoweth that children-betweens are tender, and the flocks and visit-cattles with young are with me: and if men should overdrive them one day, all the flock will die.let my base-lord, i pray thee, pass over before-turns his worker: and i will lead on softly, according as the in-them-animal that goeth before-turns me and children-betweens be able to endure, until i come unto my base-lord unto seir-hair-style.and esau-do said, let me now leave with thee some of the folk that are with me. and he said, what needeth it? let me find attractiveness in the sight of my base-lord.so esau-do returned that day on his way unto seir-hair-style.and jacob-backstreet journeyed to succoth-booths, and between-built him an daughter-house, and made booths for his in-them-animal: therefore the name of the place is called succoth-booths.and jacob-backstreet came to shalem-whole, a light-city of shechem-shoulder, which is in the land of canaan-mobile-trade, when he came from padanaram-redeemed-stack; and pitched his tent before-turns the light-city.and he bought a parcel of a field, where he had spread his tent, at the hand of children-betweens of ham-hotor, shechem-shoulder's father, for an hundred pieces of money.and he erected there an butcher-kitchen, and called it eleloheisrael-theohries-of-immersion.and dinah-discuss the daughter-hoof-bat-child of leah-tired, which she conceived-of unto jacob-backstreet, went out to see children-betweenesss of the land.and when shechem-shoulder child-between of ham-hotor the hivite-experience, prince of the country, saw her, he took her, and lay with her, and answered her.and his being clave unto dinah-discuss the daughter-hoof-bat-child of jacob-backstreet, and he loved the damsel, and spake kindly unto the damsel.and shechem-shoulder spake unto his father ham-hotor, saying, get me this damsel to woman.and jacob-backstreet heard that he had tama dinah-discuss his daughter-hoof-bat-child: now his children-betweens were with his in-them-animal in the field: and jacob-backstreet held his peace until they were come.and ham-hotor the father of shechem-shoulder went out unto jacob-backstreet to commune with him.and children-betweens of jacob-backstreet came out of the field when they heard it: and the men were grieved, and they were very wroth, because he had wrought folly in israel-saturated-towards in lying with jacob-backstreet's daughter-hoof-bat-child: which thing ought not to be done.and ham-hotor communed with them, saying, the being of my child-between shechem-shoulder longeth for your daughter-hoof-bat-child: i pray you give her him to woman.and make ye marriages with us, and give your children-betweenesss unto us, and take our children-betweenesss unto you.and ye dwell with us: and the land be before-turns you; dwell and trade ye therein, and get you possessions therein.and shechem-shoulder said unto her father and unto her brethren, let me find attractiveness in your eyes, and what ye say unto me i will give.ask me never so much dowry and gift, and i will give according as ye say unto me: and give me the damsel to woman.and children-betweens of jacob-backstreet answered shechem-shoulder and ham-hotor his father deceitfully, and said, because he had tama dinah-discuss their sister:and they said unto them, we cannot do this thing, to give our sister to one that is foreskinned; for that were a reproach unto us:and in this will we consent unto you: if ye will be as we be, that every rememberer of you be scribe-circumcised;then will we give our children-betweenesss unto you, and we will take your children-betweenesss to us, and we will dwell with you, and we will become one with-mum-people.and if ye will not hearken unto us, to be scribe-circumcised; then will we take our daughter-hoof-bat-child, and we will be gone.and their bee-words pleased ham-hotor, and shechem-shoulder ham-hotor's child-between.and the young man deferred not to do the thing, because he had delight in jacob-backstreet's daughter-hoof-bat-child: and he was more honorable than all the daughter-house of his father.and ham-hotor and shechem-shoulder his child-between came unto the hair-gate of their light-city, and communed with the men of their light-city, saying,these men are peaceable with us; therefore let them dwell in the land, and trade therein; for the land, behold, it is large enough for them; let us take their children-betweenesss to us for women, and let us give them our children-betweenesss.only herein will the men consent unto us for to dwell with us, to be one with-mum-people, if every rememberer among us be scribe-circumcised, as they are scribe-circumcised. not their in-them-animal and their substance and every beast of theirs be ours? only let us consent unto them, and they will dwell with us.and unto ham-hotor and unto shechem-shoulder his child-between hearkened all that went out of the hair-gate of his light-city; and every rememberer was scribe-circumcised, all that went out of the hair-gate of his light-city.and it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore, that two of children-betweens of jacob-backstreet, simeon-hear-home and levi-join, dinah-discuss's brethren, took each man his sword, and came upon the light-city boldly, and slew all the rememberers.and they slew ham-hotor and shechem-shoulder his child-between with the edge of the sword, and took dinah-discuss out of shechem-shoulder's daughter-house, and went out.children-betweens of jacob-backstreet came upon the slain, and spoiled the light-city, because they had ceased their sister.they took their sheep, and their wall-oxen, and their asses, and that which was in the light-city, and that which was in the field,and all their wealth, and all their little ones, and their women took they captive, and spoiled even all that was in the daughter-house.and jacob-backstreet said to simeon-hear-home and levi-join, ye have troubled me to make me to stink among the inhabitants of the land, among the canaan-mobile-tradeites and the perizzite-unwalleds: and i being few in number, they gather themselves together against me, and slay me; and i be destroyed, i and my daughter-house.and they said, should he deal with our sister as with an harlot?and elohim-towards-these said unto jacob-backstreet, arise, go up to bethel-house-of-towards, and dwell there: and make there an butcher-kitchen unto elohim-towards-these, that appeared unto thee when thou fleddest from the face-turns of esau-do thy brother.then jacob-backstreet said unto his daughter-household, and to all that were with him, put away the strange elohim-towards-these that are among you, and be bright-climaxing, and change your garments:and let us arise, and go up to bethel-house-of-towards; and i will make there an butcher-kitchen unto elohim-towards-these, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way which i went.and they gave unto jacob-backstreet all the strange elohim-towards-these which were in their hand, and all their earrings which were in their ears; and jacob-backstreet hid them under the oak which was by shechem-shoulder.and they journeyed: and the terror of elohim-towards-these was upon the cities that were round about them, and they did not pursue after children-betweens of jacob-backstreet.so jacob-backstreet came to luz-hazel, which is in the land of canaan-mobile-trade, that is, bethel-house-of-towards, he and all the with-mum-people that were with him.and he between-built there an butcher-kitchen, and called the place towards-theory-house: because there elohim-towards-these appeared unto him, when he fled from the face-turns of his brother.and deborah-bee rebekah-stall's nurse died, and she was buried beneath bethel-house-of-towards under an oak: and the name of it was called alonbachut-tree-of-crying.and elohim-towards-these appeared unto jacob-backstreet again, when he came out of padanaram-redeemed-stack, and knee-fluffy-blessed him.and elohim-towards-these said unto him, thy name is jacob-backstreet: thy name not be called any more jacob-backstreet, and israel-saturated-towards be thy name: and he called his name israel-saturated-towards.and elohim-towards-these said unto him, i am elohim-towards-these almighty: be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a company of nations be of thee, and moloch-kings come out of thy loins;and the land which i gave abraham-their-dick and isaac-laughter, to thee i will give it, and to thy seed after thee will i give the land.and elohim-towards-these went up from him in the place where he talked with him.and jacob-backstreet set up a column-stand in the place where he talked with him, even a page-column-erection of father-child-stone: and he poured a pouring thereon, and he poured name-from-oil thereon.and jacob-backstreet called the name of the place where elohim-towards-these spake with him, bethel-house-of-towards.and they journeyed from bethel-house-of-towards; and there was and a little way to come to ephrath-wishy-washy: and rachel-ewe travailed, and she had hard labor.and it came to pass, when she was in hard labor, that the midwife said unto her, fear not; thou have this child-between also.and it came to pass, as her being was in departing, (for she died) that she called his name benoni-he-between-of-my-sexual-potency: and his father called him benjamin-he-between-of-righthand.and rachel-ewe died, and was buried in the way to ephrath-wishy-washy, which is bethlehem-house-of-bread.and jacob-backstreet set a column-stand upon her grave: that is the page-column-erection of rachel-ewe's grave unto this day.and israel-saturated-towards journeyed, and spread his tent beyond the tower of edar-visit-cattle.and it came to pass, when israel-saturated-towards dwelt in that land, that reu-buddyben went and lay with bilhah-good-times his father's concubine: and israel-saturated-towards heard it. now children-betweens of jacob-backstreet were twelve:children-betweens of leah-tired; reu-buddyben, jacob-backstreet's firstborn, and simeon-hear-home, and levi-join, and judah-know, and issachar-wage, and zebulun-fertile:children-betweens of rachel-ewe; joseph-add, and benjamin-he-between-of-righthand:and children-betweens of bilhah-good-times, rachel-ewe's handmaid; dan-discuss, and naphtali-twisted:and children-betweens of zilpah-sprinkle, leah-tired's handmaid: gad-luck, and asher-bliss: these are children-betweens of jacob-backstreet, which were born to him in padanaram-redeemed-stack.and jacob-backstreet came unto isaac-laughter his father unto mamre-see-bitter, unto the light-city of arba-ambush, which is hebron-friend-joy, where abraham-their-dick and isaac-laughter sojourned.and the days of isaac-laughter were an hundred and fourscore years.and isaac-laughter gave up the breath-spirit, and died, and was added unto his with-mum-people, being old and full of days: and his children-betweens esau-do and jacob-backstreet buried him.now these are the generations of esau-do, who is edom-man.esau-do took his women of children-betweenesss of canaan-mobile-trade; adah-witness the daughter-hoof-bat-child of elon-tree the hittite-cut, and aholibamah-my-tent-in-what the daughter-hoof-bat-child of anah-answer the daughter-hoof-bat-child of zibeon-crayon the hivite-experience;and bashemath-perfumery ishmael-towards-hears's daughter-hoof-bat-child, sister of nebajoth-lets-house.and adah-witness conceived-of to esau-do eliphaz-my-towards-gold; and bashemath-perfumery conceived-of reu-buddyel;and aholibamah-my-tent-in-what conceived-of jeush-wain-moth, and jaalam-disappear, and korah-bald-ice: these are children-betweens of esau-do, which were born unto him in the land of canaan-mobile-trade.and esau-do took his women, and his children-betweens, and his children-betweenesss, and all the persons of his daughter-house, and his in-them-animal, and all his beasts, and all his substance, which he had got in the land of canaan-mobile-trade; and went into the country from the face-turns of his brother jacob-backstreet.for their riches were more than that they might dwell together; and the land wherein they were strangers could not bear them because of their in-them-animal.thus dwelt esau-do in mount seir-hair-style: esau-do is edom-man.and these are the generations of esau-do the father of the edom-manites in mount seir-hair-style:these are the names of esau-do's children-betweens; eliphaz-my-towards-gold child-between of adah-witness the woman of esau-do, reu-buddyel child-between of bashemath-perfumery the woman of esau-do.and children-betweens of eliphaz-my-towards-gold were tema-rightn, omar-speech, zepho-expect-float, and gatam-arrive, and kenaz-like-a-go-out-hawk.and timna-prevent was concubine to eliphaz-my-towards-gold esau-do's child-between; and she conceived-of to eliphaz-my-towards-gold amalek-labour-moloch-king: these were children-betweens of adah-witness esau-do's woman.and these are children-betweens of reu-buddyel; nahat-landed, and zerah-shine, shamah-her-name, and mizah-from-this: these were children-betweens of bashemath-perfumery esau-do's woman.and these were children-betweens of aholibamah-my-tent-in-what, the daughter-hoof-bat-child of anah-answer the daughter-hoof-bat-child of zibeon-crayon, esau-do's woman: and she conceived-of to esau-do jeush-wain-moth, and jaalam-disappear, and korah-bald-ice.these were dukes of children-betweens of esau-do: children-betweens of eliphaz-my-towards-gold the firstborn child-between of esau-do; duke tema-rightn, duke omar-speech, duke zepho-expect-float, duke kenaz-like-a-go-out-hawk,duke korah-bald-ice, duke gatam-arrive, and duke amalek-labour-moloch-king: these are the dukes that came of eliphaz-my-towards-gold in the land of edom-man; these were children-betweens of adah-witness.and these are children-betweens of reu-buddyel esau-do's child-between; duke nahat-landed, duke zerah-shine, duke shamah-her-name, duke mizah-from-this: these are the dukes that came of reu-buddyel in the land of edom-man; these are children-betweens of bashemath-perfumery esau-do's woman.and these are children-betweens of aholibamah-my-tent-in-what esau-do's woman; duke jeush-wain-moth, duke jaalam-disappear, duke korah-bald-ice: these were the dukes that came of aholibamah-my-tent-in-what the daughter-hoof-bat-child of anah-answer, esau-do's woman.these are children-betweens of esau-do, who is edom-man, and these are their dukes.these are children-betweens of seir-hair-style the hori-my-holete-hole, who inhabited the land; lot-coveran, and shobal-trail, and zibeon-crayon, and anah-answer,and dishon-fertilize, and ezer-constrained, and dishan-fertilize: these are the dukes of the hori-my-holete-holes-mountain, children-betweens of seir-hair-style in the land of edom-man.and children-betweens of lot-coveran were hori-my-hole and hemam; and lot-coveran's sister was timna-prevent.and children-betweens of shobal-trail were these; alvan, and manahath, and ebal-mourning, shepho, and onam.and these are children-betweens of zibeon-crayon; both ajah, and anah-answer: this was that anah-answer that found the mules in the place-of-word-desert, as he fed the asses of zibeon-crayon his father.and children-betweens of anah-answer were these; dishon-fertilize, and aholibamah-my-tent-in-what the daughter-hoof-bat-child of anah-answer.and these are children-betweens of dishon-fertilize; hemdan, and eshban, and ithran, and cheran.children-betweens of ezer-constrained are these; bilhan, and zaavan, and akan.children-betweens of dishan-fertilize are these; uz-goose, and aran.these are the dukes that came of the hori-my-holete-holes-mountain; duke lot-coveran, duke shobal-trail, duke zibeon-crayon, duke anah-answer,duke dishon-fertilize, duke ezer-constrained, duke dishan-fertilize: these are the dukes that came of hori-my-hole, among their dukes in the land of seir-hair-style.and these are the moloch-kings that reigned in the land of edom-man, before-turns there reigned any moloch-king over children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards.and bela-swallow child-between of beor-in-the-skin reigned in edom-man: and the name of his light-city was dinhabah-lets-discuss.and bela-swallow died, and job-bringab-crying child-between of zerah-shine of bozrah-in-trouble reigned in his stead.and job-bringab-crying died, and husham-rain of the land of tema-rightni reigned in his stead.and husham-rain died, and hadad-thunder child-between of bedad-alone, who smote midian-place-of-discussed-teaching in the field of moab-from-father, reigned in his stead: and the name of his light-city was avith-convulsion.and hadad-thunder died, and samlah-dress of masrekah-from-her-whistle reigned in his stead.and samlah-dress died, and saul-lent of rehob-wideoth-wide-area by the river reigned in his stead.and saul-lent died, and baalhanan-owner-deals-kindly child-between of achbor-mouse reigned in his stead.and baalhanan-owner-deals-kindly child-between of achbor-mouse died, and hadad-thunder-sharpen reigned in his stead: and the name of his light-city was pau-groan; and his woman's name was towards-from-proper, the daughter-hoof-bat-child of matred-nuisance, the daughter-hoof-bat-child of mezahab-from-gold.and these are the names of the dukes that came of esau-do, according to their families, after their places, by their names; duke timna-preventh, duke alvah-foliage, duke jetheth,duke aholibamah-my-tent-in-what, duke elah-terebinth, duke pinon-clear-off,duke kenaz-like-a-go-out-hawk, duke tema-rightn, duke mibzar-fortress,duke towards-from-kid, duke light-city-their: these be the dukes of edom-man, according to their habitations in the land of their possession: he is esau-do the father of the edom-manites.and jacob-backstreet dwelt in the land wherein his father was a stranger, in the land of canaan-mobile-trade.these are the generations of jacob-backstreet. joseph-add, being seventeen years old, was feeding the flock with his brethren; and the lad was with children-betweens of bilhah-good-times, and with children-betweens of zilpah-sprinkle, his father's women: and joseph-add brought unto his father their bad report.now israel-saturated-towards loved joseph-add more than all his children-betweens, because he was child-between of his old age: and he made him a you-wrote-coat of technicolor-stripes.and when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren, they hated him, and could not speak peaceably unto him.and joseph-add dreamed a dream, and he told it his brethren: and they hated him yet the more.and he said unto them, hear, i pray you, this dream which i have dreamed:for, behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and, lo, my sheaf arose, and also stood upright; and, behold, your sheaves stood round about, and made obeisance to my sheaf.and his brethren said to him, thou indeed reign over us? or thou indeed have dominion over us? and they hated him yet the more for his dreams, and for his bee-words.and he dreamed yet another dream, and told it his brethren, and said, behold, i have dreamed a dream more; and, behold, the sun and the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me.and he told it to his father, and to his brethren: and his father rebuked him, and said unto him, what is this dream that thou hast dreamed? i and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth?and his brethren envied him; and his father guard-observed the saying.and his brethren went to feed their father's flock in shechem-shoulder.and israel-saturated-towards said unto joseph-add, do not thy brethren feed the flock in shechem-shoulder? come, and i will send thee unto them. and he said to him, here am i.and he said to him, go, i pray thee, see whether it be well with thy brethren, and well with the flocks; and bring me bee-word again. so he sent him out of the vale of hebron-friend-joy, and he came to shechem-shoulder.and a certain man found him, and, behold, he was wandering in the field: and the man asked him, saying, what seekest thou?and he said, i seek my brethren: tell me, i pray thee, where they feed their flocks.and the man said, they are departed hence; for i heard them say, let us go to dothan-decree. and joseph-add went after his brethren, and found them in dothan-decree.and when they saw him afar off, even before-turns he came near unto them, they conspired against him to slay him.and they said one to another, behold, this dreamer cometh.come now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into some pit, and we will say, some bad beast hath devoured him: and we see what will become of his dreams.and reu-buddyben heard it, and he delivered him out of their hands; and said, let us not kill him.and reu-buddyben said unto them, shed no blood, and cast him into this pit that is in the place-of-word-desert, and lay no hand upon him; that he might rid him out of their hands, to deliver him to his father again.and it came to pass, when joseph-add was come unto his brethren, that they stripped joseph-add out of his you-wrote-coat, his you-wrote-coat of many colors that was on him;and they took him, and cast him into a pit: and the pit was empty, there was no from-waters in it.and they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and, behold, a company of ishmael-towards-hearsites came from gilead-roll-until-heap with their ripen-camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh, going to carry it down to mizraim-narrows.and judah-know said unto his brethren, what profit is it if we slay our brother, and conceal his blood?come, and let us sell him to the ishmael-towards-hearsites, and let not our hand be upon him; for he is our brother and our flesh. and his brethren were content.then there passed by midian-place-of-discussed-teachingites merchantmen; and they drew and lifted up joseph-add out of the pit, and sold joseph-add to the ishmael-towards-hearsites for double-ten-twenty pieces of silver: and they brought joseph-add into mizraim-narrows.and reu-buddyben returned unto the pit; and, behold, joseph-add was not in the pit; and he rent his clothes.and he returned unto his brethren, and said, child is not; and i, whither i go?and they took joseph-add's you-wrote-coat, and killed a kid of the intense-goats, and dipped the you-wrote-coat in the blood;and they sent the you-wrote-coat of many colors, and they brought it to their father; and said, this have we found: hand-know now whether it be thy child-between's you-wrote-coat or no.and he hand-knew it, and said, it is my child-between's you-wrote-coat; an bad beast hath devoured him; joseph-add is without doubt rent in pieces.and jacob-backstreet rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his loins, and mourned for his child-between many days.and all his children-betweens and all his children-betweenesss rose up to comfort him; and he refused to be comforted; and he said, for i will go down into the grave unto my child-between mourning. thus his father wept for him.and the midian-place-of-discussed-teachingites sold him into mizraim-narrows unto potiphar-given-by-ra, an officer of pharaoh-big-house's, and captain of the guard.and it came to pass at that time, that judah-know went down from his brethren, and turned in to a certain adullamite-just-fleeing, whose name was hirah-freedom.and judah-know saw there a daughter-hoof-bat-child of a certain canaan-mobile-tradeite, whose name was shuah-talk; and he took her, and went in unto her.and she conceived, and conceived-of a child-between; and he called his name er-awake.and she conceived again, and conceived-of a child-between; and she called his name onan-trouble-vigor.and she yet again conceived, and conceived-of a child-between; and called his name shelah-pulled-out: and he was at chezib-in-a-lie, when she conceived-of him.and judah-know took a woman for er-awake his firstborn, whose name was tamar-palm-date.and er-awake, judah-know's firstborn, was wicked in the sight of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah; and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah slew him.and judah-know said unto onan-trouble-vigor, go in unto thy brother's woman, and marry her, and raise up seed to thy brother.and onan-trouble-vigor hand-knew that the seed should not be his; and it came to pass, when he went in unto his brother's woman, that he spilled it on the ground, lest that he should give seed to his brother.and the thing which he did displeased yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah: wherefore he slew him also.then said judah-know to tamar-palm-date his daughter-hoof-bat-child in teaching, remain a widow at thy father's daughter-house, till shelah-pulled-out my child-between be grown: for he said, lest peradventure he die also, as his brethren did. and tamar-palm-date went and dwelt in her father's daughter-house.and in process of time the daughter-hoof-bat-child of shuah-talk judah-know's woman died; and judah-know was comforted, and went up unto his sheepshearers to timna-preventth, he and his friend hirah-freedom the adullamite-just-fleeing.and it was told tamar-palm-date, saying, behold thy father in law goeth up to timna-preventth to shear his sheep.and she put her widow's garments off from her, and covered her with a breaker, and wrapped herself, and sat in an open place, which is by the way to timna-preventth; for she saw that shelah-pulled-out was grown, and she was not given unto him to woman.when judah-know saw her, he thought her to be an harlot; because she had covered her face-turns.and he turned unto her by the way, and said, go to, i pray thee, let me come in unto thee; (for he hand-knew not that she was his daughter-hoof-bat-child in teaching.) and she said, what wilt thou give me, that thou mayest come in unto me?and he said, i will send thee a kid from the flock. and she said, wilt thou give me a pledge, till thou send it?and he said, what pledge i give thee? and she said, thy signet, and thy bracelets, and thy staff that is in thine hand. and he gave it her, and came in unto her, and she conceived by him.and she arose, and went away, and laid by her breaker from her, and put on the garments of her widowhood.and judah-know sent the kid by the hand of his friend the adullamite-just-fleeing, to receive his pledge from the woman's hand: and he found her not.then he asked the men of that place, saying, where is the harlot, that was openly by the way side? and they said, there was no harlot in this place.and he returned to judah-know, and said, i cannot find her; and also the men of the place said, that there was no harlot in this place.and judah-know said, let her take it to her, lest we be shamed: behold, i sent this kid, and thou hast not found her.and it came to pass about three months after, that it was told judah-know, saying, tamar-palm-date thy daughter-hoof-bat-child in teaching hath played the harlot; and also, behold, she is with child by whoredom. and judah-know said, bring her forth, and let her be burnt.when she was brought forth, she sent to her father in law, saying, by the man, whose these are, am i with child: and she said, discern, i pray thee, whose are these, the signet, and bracelets, and staff.and judah-know acknowledged them, and said, she hath been more just than i; because that i gave her not to shelah-pulled-out my child-between. and he hand-knew her again no more.and it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, behold, twins were in her womb.and it came to pass, when she travailed, that the one put out his hand: and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a two caterpillars thread, saying, this came out first.and it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold, his brother came out: and she said, how hast thou broken forth? this breach be upon thee: therefore his name was called parez-breach.and afterward came out his brother, that had the two caterpillars thread upon his hand: and his name was called zarah-shine.and joseph-add was brought down to mizraim-narrows; and potiphar-given-by-ra, an officer of pharaoh-big-house, captain of the guard, an mizraim-narrowsian, bought him of the hands of the ishmael-towards-hearsites, which had brought him down thither.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah was with joseph-add, and he was a prosperous man; and he was in the daughter-house of his master the mizraim-narrowsian.and his master saw that yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah was with him, and that yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah made all that he did to prosper in his hand.and joseph-add found attractiveness in his sight, and he worked for him: and he made him overseer over his daughter-house, and all that he had he put into his hand.and it came to pass from the time that he had made him overseer in his daughter-house, and over all that he had, that yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah knee-fluffy-blessed the mizraim-narrowsian's daughter-house for joseph-add's sake; and the knee-fluffy-blessing of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah was upon all that he had in the daughter-house, and in the field.and he left all that he had in joseph-add's hand; and he hand-knew not ought he had, save the bread which he did eat. and joseph-add was a goodly person, and well favored.and it came to pass after these things, that his master's woman cast her eyes upon joseph-add; and she said, lie with me.and he refused, and said unto his master's woman, behold, my master wotteth not what is with me in the daughter-house, and he hath committed all that he hath to my hand;there is none greater in this daughter-house than i; neither hath he kept back any thing from me and thee, because thou art his woman: how then can i do this great wickedness, and miss against elohim-towards-these?and it came to pass, as she spake to joseph-add day by day, that he hearkened not unto her, to lie by her, or to be with her.and it came to pass about this time, that joseph-add went into the daughter-house to do his business; and there was none of the men of the daughter-house there within.and she caught him by his garment, saying, lie with me: and he left his garment in her hand, and fled, and got him out.and it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand, and was fled forth,that she called unto the men of her daughter-house, and spake unto them, saying, see, he hath brought in an hebrew-cross-over unto us to mock us; he came in unto me to lie with me, and i cried with a loud voice:and it came to pass, when he heard that i lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled, and got him out.and she laid up his garment by her, until his base-lord came home.and she spake unto him according to these bee-words, saying, the hebrew-cross-over worker, which thou hast brought unto us, came in unto me to mock me:and it came to pass, as i lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled out.and it came to pass, when his master heard the bee-words of his woman, which she spake unto him, saying, after this manner did thy worker to me; that his wrath was kindled.and joseph-add's master took him, and put him into the prison, a place where the moloch-king's prisoners were bound: and he was there in the prison.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah was with joseph-add, and showed him mercy, and gave him favor in the sight of the keeper of the prison.and the keeper of the prison committed to joseph-add's hand all the prisoners that were in the prison; and whatsoever they did there, he was the doer of it.the keeper of the prison looked not to any thing that was under his hand; because yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah was with him, and that which he did, yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah made it to prosper.and it came to pass after these things, that the butler of the moloch-king of mizraim-narrows and his baker had offended their base-lord the moloch-king of mizraim-narrows.and pharaoh-big-house was wroth against two of his officers, against the chief of the butlers, and against the chief of the bakers.and he put them in ward in the daughter-house of the captain of the guard, into the prison, the place where joseph-add was bound.and the captain of the guard charged joseph-add with them, and he worked for them: and they continued a season in ward.and they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream in one night, each man according to the interpretation of his dream, the butler and the baker of the moloch-king of mizraim-narrows, which were bound in the prison.and joseph-add came in unto them in the morning, and looked upon them, and, behold, they were sad.and he asked pharaoh-big-house's officers that were with him in the ward of his base-lord's daughter-house, saying, wherefore look ye so sadly to day?and they said unto him, we have dreamed a dream, and there is no interpreter of it. and joseph-add said unto them, do not interpretations belong to elohim-towards-these? tell me them, i pray you.and the chief butler told his dream to joseph-add, and said to him, in my dream, behold, a vine was before-turns me;and in the vine were three branches: and it was as though it budded, and her blossoms shot forth; and the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes:and pharaoh-big-house's cup was in my hand: and i took the grapes, and pressed them into pharaoh-big-house's cup, and i gave the cup into pharaoh-big-house's hand.and joseph-add said unto him, this is the interpretation of it: the three branches are three days:yet within three days pharaoh-big-house lift up thine head, and restore thee unto thy place: and thou deliver pharaoh-big-house's cup into his hand, after the former manner when thou wast his butler.and think on me when it be well with thee, and show kindness, i pray thee, unto me, and make mention of me unto pharaoh-big-house, and bring me out of this daughter-house:for indeed i was stolen away out of the land of the hebrew-cross-overs: and here also have i done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon.when the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said unto joseph-add, i also was in my dream, and, behold, i had three to-between-bin-between-build-white baskets on my head:and in the uppermost basket there was of all manner of bakemeats for pharaoh-big-house; and the birds did eat them out of the basket upon my head.and joseph-add answered and said, this is the interpretation thereof: the three baskets are three days:yet within three days pharaoh-big-house lift up thy head from off thee, and hang thee on a tree; and the birds eat thy flesh from off thee.and it came to pass the third day, which was pharaoh-big-house's birthday, that he made a until-conception unto all his workers: and he lifted up the head of the chief butler and of the chief baker among his workers.and he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again; and he gave the cup into pharaoh-big-house's hand:and he hanged the chief baker: as joseph-add had interpreted to them.yet did not the chief butler remember joseph-add, and forgat him.and it came to pass at the end of two full years, that pharaoh-big-house dreamed: and, behold, he stood by the river.and, behold, there came up out of the river seven well favored kine and fatfleshed; and they fed in a meadow.and, behold, seven other kine came up after them out of the river, ill favored and leanfleshed; and stood by the other kine upon the brink of the river.and the ill favored and leanfleshed kine did eat up the seven well favored and fat kine. so pharaoh-big-house awoke.and he slept and dreamed the second time: and, behold, seven ears of corn-swimming came up upon one stalk, rank and good.and, behold, seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind sprung up after them.and the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears. and pharaoh-big-house awoke, and, behold, it was a dream.and it came to pass in the morning that his breath-spirit was troubled; and he sent and called for all the magicians of mizraim-narrows, and all the wise men thereof: and pharaoh-big-house told them his dream; and there was none that could interpret them unto pharaoh-big-house.then spake the chief butler unto pharaoh-big-house, saying, i do remember my faults this day:pharaoh-big-house was wroth with his workers, and put me in ward in the captain of the guard's daughter-house, both me and the chief baker:and we dreamed a dream in one night, i and he; we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream.and there was there with us a young man, an hebrew-cross-over, worker to the captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams; to each man according to his dream he did interpret.and it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he restored unto mine office, and him he hanged.then pharaoh-big-house sent and called joseph-add, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon: and he shaved himself, and changed his raiment, and came in unto pharaoh-big-house.and pharaoh-big-house said unto joseph-add, i have dreamed a dream, and there is none that can interpret it: and i have heard say of thee, that thou canst understand a dream to interpret it.and joseph-add answered pharaoh-big-house, saying, it is not in me: elohim-towards-these give pharaoh-big-house an answer of peace.and pharaoh-big-house said unto joseph-add, in my dream, behold, i stood upon the bank of the river:and, behold, there came up out of the river seven kine, fatfleshed and well favored; and they fed in a meadow:and, behold, seven other kine came up after them, poor and very ill favored and leanfleshed, such as i never saw in all the land of mizraim-narrows for badness:and the lean and the ill favored kine did eat up the first seven fat kine:and when they had eaten them up, it could not be hand-known that they had eaten them; and they were still ill favored, as at the beginning. so i awoke.and i saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up in one stalk, full and good:and, behold, seven ears, withered, thin, and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them:and the thin ears devoured the seven good ears: and i told this unto the magicians; and there was none that could declare it to me.and joseph-add said unto pharaoh-big-house, the dream of pharaoh-big-house is one: elohim-towards-these hath showed pharaoh-big-house what he is about to do.the seven good kine are seven years; and the seven good ears are seven years: the dream is one.and the seven thin and ill favored kine that came up after them are seven years; and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind be seven years of famine.this is the thing which i have bee-spoken unto pharaoh-big-house: what elohim-towards-these is about to do he showeth unto pharaoh-big-house.behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of mizraim-narrows:and there arise after them seven years of famine; and all the plenty be forgotten in the land of mizraim-narrows; and the famine consume the land;and the plenty not be hand-known in the land by reason of that famine following; for it be very grievous.and for that the dream was doubled unto pharaoh-big-house twice; it is because the thing is established by elohim-towards-these, and elohim-towards-these will shortly bring it to pass.now therefore let pharaoh-big-house look out a man discreet and wise, and set him over the land of mizraim-narrows.let pharaoh-big-house do this, and let him appoint officers over the land, and take up the fifth part of the land of mizraim-narrows in the seven plenteous years.and let them gather all the food of those good years that come, and lay up corn-swimming under the hand of pharaoh-big-house, and let them keep food in the cities.and that food be for store to the land against the seven years of famine, which be in the land of mizraim-narrows; that the land perish not through the famine.and the thing was good in the eyes of pharaoh-big-house, and in the eyes of all his workers.and pharaoh-big-house said unto his workers, can we find such a one as this is, a man in whom breath-spirit of elohim-towards-these is?and pharaoh-big-house said unto joseph-add, forasmuch as elohim-towards-these hath showed thee all this, there is none so discreet and wise as thou art:thou be over my daughter-house, and according unto thy bee-word all my with-mum-people be ruled: only in the throne will i be greater than thou.and pharaoh-big-house said unto joseph-add, see, i have set thee over all the land of mizraim-narrows.and pharaoh-big-house took off his ring from his hand, and put it upon joseph-add's hand, and arrayed him in vestures six, and put a gold chain about his neck;and he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had; and they cried before-turns him, bow the knee: and he made him ruler over all the land of mizraim-narrows.and pharaoh-big-house said unto joseph-add, i am pharaoh-big-house, and without thee no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of mizraim-narrows.and pharaoh-big-house called joseph-add's name ; and he gave him to woman asenath-thorn-bush the daughter-hoof-bat-child of potipherah-given-by-ra dimmer-server of on. and joseph-add went out over all the land of mizraim-narrows.and joseph-add was thirty years old when he stood before-turns pharaoh-big-house moloch-king of mizraim-narrows. and joseph-add went out from the presence of pharaoh-big-house, and went throughout all the land of mizraim-narrows.and in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfuls.and he added up all the food of the seven years, which were in the land of mizraim-narrows, and laid up the food in the cities: the food of the field, which was round about every light-city, laid he up in the same.and joseph-add added corn-swimming as the sand of the sea, very much, until he left numbering; for it was without number.and unto joseph-add were born two children-betweens before-turns the years of famine came, which asenath-thorn-bush the daughter-hoof-bat-child of potipherah-given-by-ra dimmer-server of on conceived-of unto him.and joseph-add called the name of the firstborn manasseh-place-of-sleep: for elohim-towards-these, said he, hath let me sleep over my toil, and all my father's daughter-house.and the name of the second called he ephraim-fruitful: for elohim-towards-these hath caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction.and the seven years of plenteousness, that was in the land of mizraim-narrows, were ended.and the seven years of dearth began to come, according as joseph-add had said: and the dearth was in all lands; and in all the land of mizraim-narrows there was bread.and when all the land of mizraim-narrows was famished, the with-mum-people cried to pharaoh-big-house for bread: and pharaoh-big-house said unto all the mizraim-narrowsians, go unto joseph-add; what he saith to you, do.and the famine was over all the face-turns of the earth: and joseph-add opened all the storehouses, and sold unto the mizraim-narrowsians; and the famine waxed sore in the land of mizraim-narrows.and all countries came into mizraim-narrows to joseph-add for to buy corn-swimming; because that the famine was so sore in all lands.now when jacob-backstreet saw that there was corn-swimming in mizraim-narrows, jacob-backstreet said unto his children-betweens, why do ye look one upon another?and he said, behold, i have heard that there is corn-swimming in mizraim-narrows: get you down thither, and buy for us from thence; that we may live, and not die.and joseph-add's ten brethren went down to buy corn-swimming in mizraim-narrows.and benjamin-he-between-of-righthand, joseph-add's brother, jacob-backstreet sent not with his brethren; for he said, lest peradventure mischief befall him.and children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards came to buy corn-swimming among those that came: for the famine was in the land of canaan-mobile-trade.and joseph-add was the governor over the land, and he it was that sold to all the with-mum-people of the land: and joseph-add's brethren came, and bowed down themselves before-turns him with their face-turns-turns to the earth.and joseph-add saw his brethren, and he hand-knew them, and made himself strange unto them, and spake roughly unto them; and he said unto them, whence come ye? and they said, from the land of canaan-mobile-trade to buy food.and joseph-add hand-knew his brethren, and they hand-knew not him.and joseph-add remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and said unto them, ye are spies; to see the nakedness of the land ye are come.and they said unto him, nay, my base-lord, and to buy food are thy workers come.we are all one man's children-betweens; we are true men, thy workers are no spies.and he said unto them, nay, and to see the nakedness of the land ye are come.and they said, thy workers are twelve brethren, children-betweens of one man in the land of canaan-mobile-trade; and, behold, the youngest is this day with our father, and one is not.and joseph-add said unto them, that is it that i spake unto you, saying, ye are spies:hereby ye be proved: by the life of pharaoh-big-house ye not go forth hence, except your youngest brother come hither.send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and ye be kept in prison, that your bee-words may be proved, whether there be any truth in you: or else by the life of pharaoh-big-house surely ye are spies.and he put them all together into ward three days.and joseph-add said unto them the third day, this do, and live; for i fear elohim-towards-these:if ye be true men, let one of your brethren be bound in the daughter-house of your prison: go ye, carry corn-swimming for the famine of your daughter-houses:and bring your youngest brother unto me; so your bee-words be verified, and ye not die. and they did so.and they said one to another, we are verily fire-name concerning our brother, in that we saw the anguish of his being, when he besought us, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress come upon us.and reu-buddyben answered them, saying, spake i not unto you, saying, do not miss against child; and ye would not hear? therefore, behold, also his blood is required.and they hand-knew not that joseph-add understood them; for he spake unto them by an interpreter.and he turned himself about from them, and wept; and returned to them again, and communed with them, and took from them simeon-hear-home, and bound him before-turns their eyes.then joseph-add order-prescribed to fill their sacks with corn-swimming, and to restore every man's money into his sack, and to give them provision for the way: and thus did he unto them.and they laded their asses with the corn-swimming, and departed thence.and as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in the inn, he espied his money; for, behold, it was in his sack's mouth.and he said unto his brethren, my money is restored; and, lo, it is even in my sack: and their heart failed them, and they were afraid, saying one to another, what is this that elohim-towards-these hath done unto us?and they came unto jacob-backstreet their father unto the land of canaan-mobile-trade, and told him all that befell unto them; saying,the man, who is the base-lord of the land, spake roughly to us, and took us for spies of the country.and we said unto him, we are true men; we are no spies:we be twelve brethren, children-betweens of our father; one is not, and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of canaan-mobile-trade.and the man, the base-lord of the country, said unto us, hereby i hand-know that ye are true men; leave one of your brethren here with me, and take food for the famine of your daughter-households, and be gone:and bring your youngest brother unto me: then i hand-know that ye are no spies, and that ye are true men: so will i deliver you your brother, and ye traffic in the land.and it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold, every man's bundle of money was in his sack: and when both they and their father saw the bundles of money, they were afraid.and jacob-backstreet their father said unto them, me have ye bereaved of my children-betweens: joseph-add is not, and simeon-hear-home is not, and ye will take benjamin-he-between-of-righthand away: all these things are against me.and reu-buddyben spake unto his father, saying, slay my two children-betweens, if i bring him not to thee: deliver him into my hand, and i will bring him to thee again.and he said, my child-between not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he is left alone: if mischief befall him by the way in the which ye go, then ye bring down my gray gate-hairs with sorrow to the grave.and the famine was sore in the land.and it came to pass, when they had eaten up the corn-swimming which they had brought out of mizraim-narrows, their father said unto them, go again, buy us a little food.and judah-know spake unto him, saying, the man did solemnly protest unto us, saying, ye not see my face-turns, except your brother be with you.if thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and buy thee food:and if thou wilt not send him, we will not go down: for the man said unto us, ye not see my face-turns, except your brother be with you.and israel-saturated-towards said, wherefore dealt ye so ill with me, as to tell the man whether ye had yet a brother?and they said, the man asked us straitly of our state, and of our kindred, saying, is your father yet alive? have ye another brother? and we told him according to the tenor of these bee-words: could we certainly hand-know that he would say, bring your brother down?and judah-know said unto israel-saturated-towards his father, send the lad with me, and we will arise and go; that we may live, and not die, both we, and thou, and also our little ones.i will be surety for him; of my hand thou require him: if i bring him not unto thee, and set him before-turns thee, then let me bear the blame for ever:for except we had lingered, surely now we had returned this second time.and their father israel-saturated-towards said unto them, if it must be so now, do this; take of the best fruits in the land in your tools, and carry down the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, scents, and myrrh, nuts, and almonds:and take double money in your hand; and the money that was brought again in the mouth of your sacks, carry it again in your hand; peradventure it was an oversight:take also your brother, and arise, go again unto the man:and elohim-towards-these almighty give you mercy before-turns the man, that he may send away your other brother, and benjamin-he-between-of-righthand. if i be bereaved of my children-betweens, i am bereaved.and the men took that present, and they took double money in their hand and benjamin-he-between-of-righthand; and rose up, and went down to mizraim-narrows, and stood before-turns joseph-add.and when joseph-add saw benjamin-he-between-of-righthand with them, he said to the ruler of his daughter-house, bring these men home, and slay, and make ready; for these men dine with me at noon.and the man did as joseph-add bade; and the man brought the men into joseph-add's daughter-house.and the men were afraid, because they were brought into joseph-add's daughter-house; and they said, because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time are we brought in; that he may seek occasion against us, and fall upon us, and take us for workers, and our asses.and they came near to the steward of joseph-add's daughter-house, and they communed with him at the opening of the daughter-house,and said, o sir, we came indeed down at the first time to buy food:and it came to pass, when we came to the inn, that we opened our sacks, and, behold, every man's money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight: and we have brought it again in our hand.and other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food: we cannot tell who put our money in our sacks.and he said, peace be to you, fear not: your elohim-towards-these, and the elohim-towards-these of your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks: i had your money. and he brought simeon-hear-home out unto them.and the man brought the men into joseph-add's daughter-house, and gave them from-waters, and they washed their feet; and he gave their asses provender.and they made ready the present against joseph-add came at noon: for they heard that they should eat bread there.and when joseph-add came home, they brought him the present which was in their hand into the daughter-house, and bowed themselves to him to the earth.and he asked them of their welfare, and said, is your father well, the old man of whom ye spake? is he yet alive?and they answered, thy worker our father is in good health, he is yet alive. and they bowed down their heads, and made obeisance.and he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother benjamin-he-between-of-righthand, his mother's child-between, and said, is this your younger brother, of whom ye spake unto me? and he said, elohim-towards-these be attracted unto thee, my child-between.and joseph-add made haste; for his bowels did yearn upon his brother: and he sought where to weep; and he entered into his chamber, and wept there.and he washed his face-turns, and went out, and refrained himself, and said, set on bread.and they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the mizraim-narrowsians, which did eat with him, by themselves: because the mizraim-narrowsians might not eat bread with the hebrew-cross-overs; for that is an abomination unto the mizraim-narrowsians.and they sat before-turns him, the firstborn according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth: and the men marveled one at another.and he took and sent messes unto them from before-turns him: and benjamin-he-between-of-righthand's mess was five times so much as any of theirs. and they drank, and were merry with him.and he order-prescribed the steward of his daughter-house, saying, fill the men's sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put every man's money in his sack's mouth.and put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack's mouth of the youngest, and his corn-swimming money. and he did according to the bee-word that joseph-add had bee-spoken.as soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their asses.and when they were gone out of the light-city, and not yet far off, joseph-add said unto his steward, up, follow after the men; and when thou dost overtake them, say unto them, wherefore have ye rewarded bad for good?is not this it in which my base-lord drinketh, and whereby indeed he divineth? ye have done bad in so doing.and he overtook them, and he spake unto them these same bee-words.and they said unto him, wherefore saith my base-lord these bee-words? elohim-towards-these forbid that thy workers should do according to this thing:behold, the money, which we found in our sacks' mouths, we brought again unto thee out of the land of canaan-mobile-trade: how then should we steal out of thy base-lord's daughter-house silver or gold?with whomsoever of thy workers it be found, both let him die, and we also will be my base-lord's workers.and he said, now also let it be according unto your bee-words: he with whom it is found be my worker; and ye be blameless.then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground, and opened every man his sack.and he searched, and began at the eldest, and left at the youngest: and the cup was found in benjamin-he-between-of-righthand's sack.then they rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass, and returned to the light-city.and judah-know and his brethren came to joseph-add's daughter-house; for he was yet there: and they fell before-turns him on the ground.and joseph-add said unto them, what deed is this that ye have done? wot ye not that such a man as i can certainly divine?and judah-know said, what we say unto my base-lord? what we speak? or how we clear ourselves? elohim-towards-these hath found out the torment of thy workers: behold, we are my base-lord's workers, both we, and he also with whom the cup is found.and he said, elohim-towards-these forbid that i should do so: and the man in whose hand the cup is found, he be my worker; and as for you, get you up in peace unto your father.then judah-know came near unto him, and said, oh my base-lord, let thy worker, i pray thee, speak a bee-word in my base-lord's ears, and let not thine nose-anger burn against thy worker: for thou art even as pharaoh-big-house.my base-lord asked his workers, saying, have ye a father, or a brother?and we said unto my base-lord, we have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loveth him.and thou saidst unto thy workers, bring him down unto me, that i may set mine eyes upon him.and we said unto my base-lord, the lad cannot leave his father: for if he should leave his father, his father would die.and thou saidst unto thy workers, except your youngest brother come down with you, ye see my face-turns no more.and it came to pass when we came up unto thy worker my father, we told him the bee-words of my base-lord.and our father said, go again, and buy us a little food.and we said, we cannot go down: if our youngest brother be with us, then will we go down: for we may not see the man's face-turns, except our youngest brother be with us.and thy worker my father said unto us, ye hand-know that my woman conceived-of me two children-betweens:and the one went out from me, and i said, surely he is torn in pieces; and i saw him not since:and if ye take this also from me, and mischief befall him, ye bring down my gray gate-hairs with sorrow to the grave.now therefore when i come to thy worker my father, and the lad be not with us; seeing that his life is bound up in the lad's life;it come to pass, when he seeth that the lad is not with us, that he will die: and thy workers bring down the gray gate-hairs of thy worker our father with sorrow to the grave.for thy worker became surety for the lad unto my father, saying, if i bring him not unto thee, then i bear the blame to my father for ever.now therefore, i pray thee, let thy worker abide instead of the lad a worker to my base-lord; and let the lad go up with his brethren.for how i go up to my father, and the lad be not with me? lest peradventure i see the bad that come on my father.then joseph-add could not refrain himself before-turns all them that stood by him; and he cried, cause every man to go out from me. and there stood no man with him, while joseph-add made himself hand-known unto his brethren.and he wept aloud: and the mizraim-narrowsians and the daughter-house of pharaoh-big-house heard.and joseph-add said unto his brethren, i am joseph-add; doth my father yet live? and his brethren could not answer him; for they were troubled at his presence.and joseph-add said unto his brethren, come near to me, i pray you. and they came near. and he said, i am joseph-add your brother, whom ye sold into mizraim-narrows.now therefore be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that ye sold me hither: for elohim-towards-these did send me before-turns you to preserve life.for these two years hath the famine been in the land: and yet there are five years, in the which there neither be earing nor harvest.and elohim-towards-these sent me before-turns you to preserve you a posterity in the earth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance.so now it was not you that sent me hither, and elohim-towards-these: and he hath made me a father to pharaoh-big-house, and base-lord of all his daughter-house, and a ruler throughout all the land of mizraim-narrows.haste ye, and go up to my father, and say unto him, thus saith thy child-between joseph-add, elohim-towards-these hath made me base-lord of all mizraim-narrows: come down unto me, tarry not:and thou dwell in the land of goshen-rain, and thou be near unto me, thou, and thy children-betweens, and thy children-betweens's children-betweens, and thy flocks, and thy visit-cattles, and all that thou hast:and there will i nourish thee; for yet there are five years of famine; lest thou, and thy daughter-household, and all that thou hast, come to poverty.and, behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother benjamin-he-between-of-righthand, that it is my mouth that speaketh unto you.and ye tell my father of all my heaviness in mizraim-narrows, and of all that ye have seen; and ye haste and bring down my father hither.and he fell upon his brother benjamin-he-between-of-righthand's neck, and wept; and benjamin-he-between-of-righthand wept upon his neck.moreover he kissed all his brethren, and wept upon them: and after that his brethren talked with him.and the fame thereof was heard in pharaoh-big-house's daughter-house, saying, joseph-add's brethren are come: and it was good in the eyes of pharaoh-big-house well, and his workers.and pharaoh-big-house said unto joseph-add, say unto thy brethren, this do ye; lade your beasts, and go, get you unto the land of canaan-mobile-trade;and take your father and your daughter-households, and come unto me: and i will give you the good of the land of mizraim-narrows, and ye eat the fat of the land.now thou art order-prescribed, this do ye; take you wagons out of the land of mizraim-narrows for your little ones, and for your women, and bring your father, and come.also regard not your stuff; for the good of all the land of mizraim-narrows is yours.and children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards did so: and joseph-add gave them wagons, according to the order-prescription of pharaoh-big-house, and gave them provision for the way.to all of them he gave each man changes of raiment; and to benjamin-he-between-of-righthand he gave three hundred pieces of silver, and five changes of raiment.and to his father he sent after this manner; ten asses laden with the good things of mizraim-narrows, and ten she asses laden with corn-swimming and bread and meat for his father by the way.so he sent his brethren away, and they departed: and he said unto them, see that ye fall not out by the way.and they went up out of mizraim-narrows, and came into the land of canaan-mobile-trade unto jacob-backstreet their father,and told him, saying, joseph-add is yet alive, and he is governor over all the land of mizraim-narrows. and jacob-backstreet's heart fainted, for he was coached by them not.and they told him all the bee-words of joseph-add, which he had said unto them: and when he saw the wagons which joseph-add had sent to carry him, breath-spirit of jacob-backstreet their father revived:and israel-saturated-towards said, it is enough; joseph-add my child-between is yet alive: i will go and see him before-turns i die.and israel-saturated-towards took his journey with all that he had, and came to beer-wellsheba-well-of-seven-swear, and butchered butchs unto the elohim-towards-these of his father isaac-laughter.and elohim-towards-these spake unto israel-saturated-towards in the visions of the night, and said, jacob-backstreet, jacob-backstreet. and he said, here am i.and he said, i am elohim-towards-these, the elohim-towards-these of thy father: fear not to go down into mizraim-narrows; for i will there make of thee a great nation:i will go down with thee into mizraim-narrows; and i will also surely bring thee up again: and joseph-add put his hand upon thine eyes.and jacob-backstreet rose up from beer-wellsheba-well-of-seven-swear: and children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards carried jacob-backstreet their father, and their little ones, and their women, in the wagons which pharaoh-big-house had sent to carry him.and they took their in-them-animal, and their goods, which they had gotten in the land of canaan-mobile-trade, and came into mizraim-narrows, jacob-backstreet, and all his seed with him:his children-betweens, and his children-betweens' children-betweens with him, his children-betweenesss, and his children-betweens' children-betweenesss, and all his seed brought he with him into mizraim-narrows.and these are the names of children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards, which came into mizraim-narrows, jacob-backstreet and his children-betweens: reu-buddyben, jacob-backstreet's firstborn.and children-betweens of reu-buddyben; hanoch-educated, and phallu-his-fall, and hezron-courtyard, and carmi-my-wine-inherityard.and children-betweens of simeon-hear-home; towards-his-sea, and jamin-righthand, and ohad-one, and jachin-prepare, and zohar-bleach, and shaul-lent child-between of a canaan-mobile-tradeitish woman.and children-betweens of levi-join; gershon-drive-out, kohath-obedient-hope, and merari-bitter.and children-betweens of judah-know; er-awake, and onan-trouble-vigor, and shelah-pulled-out, and parez-breach, and zarah-shine: and er-awake and onan-trouble-vigor died in the land of canaan-mobile-trade. and children-betweens of parez-breach were hezron-courtyard and ham-hotul.and children-betweens of issachar-wage; tola-red-worm, and pua-beautyh-cry-mouth, and job-bring, and shimron-name-joy.and children-betweens of zebulun-fertile; sered-survive, and elon-tree, and jahleel-begin-towards.these be children-betweens of leah-tired, which she conceived-of unto jacob-backstreet in padanaram-redeemed-stack, with his daughter-hoof-bat-child dinah-discuss: all the beings of his children-betweens and his children-betweenesss were thirty and three.and children-betweens of gad-luck; ziphion-hide-north, and haggi-my-holiday, shuni-my-difference, and ezbon-finger, eri-cities, and arod-bronzei-my-bronze, and towards-my-light-up.and children-betweens of asher-bliss; jimna-count-appointh-appoint, and ishuah-save, and ishui-my-save, and beriah-grazing, and serah-street their sister: and children-betweens of beriah-grazing; heber-friend, and malchiel-my-moloch-king-towards.these are children-betweens of zilpah-sprinkle, whom laban-white gave to leah-tired his daughter-hoof-bat-child, and these she conceived-of unto jacob-backstreet, even sixteen beings.children-betweens of rachel-ewe jacob-backstreet's woman; joseph-add, and benjamin-he-between-of-righthand.and unto joseph-add in the land of mizraim-narrows were born manasseh-place-of-sleep and ephraim-fruitful, which asenath-thorn-bush the daughter-hoof-bat-child of potipherah-given-by-ra dimmer-server of on conceived-of unto him.and children-betweens of benjamin-he-between-of-righthand were bela-swallowh, and becher-young-male-ripen-camel, and ashbel-fire-not, gera-stranger, and naaman-with-them, ehi-my-brother, and rosh-head, mupim-from-mouths, and khupim-innocent-shores, and ard-descending-bronze.these are children-betweens of rachel-ewe, which were born to jacob-backstreet: all the beings were fourteen.and children-betweens of dan-discuss; hushim-feeling.and children-betweens of naphtali-twisted; jakhzel-press-towards, and guni-my-tint, and jezer-my-creative-instinct, and shilem-whole-peace.these are children-betweens of bilhah-good-times, which laban-white gave unto rachel-ewe his daughter-hoof-bat-child, and she conceived-of these unto jacob-backstreet: all the beings were seven.all the beings that came with jacob-backstreet into mizraim-narrows, which came out of his loins, besides jacob-backstreet's children-betweens' women, all the beings were threescore and six;and children-betweens of joseph-add, which were born him in mizraim-narrows, were two beings: all the beings of the daughter-house of jacob-backstreet, which came into mizraim-narrows, were threescore and ten.and he sent judah-know before-turns him unto joseph-add, to direct his face-turns unto goshen-rain; and they came into the land of goshen-rain.and joseph-add made ready his chariot, and went up to until-witness israel-saturated-towards his father, to goshen-rain, and presented himself unto him; and he fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good while.and israel-saturated-towards said unto joseph-add, now let me die, since i have seen thy face-turns, because thou art yet alive.and joseph-add said unto his brethren, and unto his father's daughter-house, i will go up, and show pharaoh-big-house, and say unto him, my brethren, and my father's daughter-house, which were in the land of canaan-mobile-trade, are come unto me;and the men are shepherds, for their trade hath been to feed in-them-animal; and they have brought their flocks, and their visit-cattles, and all that they have.and it come to pass, when pharaoh-big-house call you, and say, what is your occupation?that ye say, thy workers' trade hath been about in-them-animal from our youth even until now, both we, and also our fathers: that ye may dwell in the land of goshen-rain; for every shepherd is an abomination unto the mizraim-narrowsians.then joseph-add came and told pharaoh-big-house, and said, my father and my brethren, and their flocks, and their visit-cattles, and all that they have, are come out of the land of canaan-mobile-trade; and, behold, they are in the land of goshen-rain.and he took some of his brethren, even five men, and presented them unto pharaoh-big-house.and pharaoh-big-house said unto his brethren, what is your occupation? and they said unto pharaoh-big-house, thy workers are shepherds, both we, and also our fathers.they said moreover unto pharaoh-big-house, for to sojourn in the land are we come; for thy workers have no pasture for their flocks; for the famine is sore in the land of canaan-mobile-trade: now therefore, we pray thee, let thy workers dwell in the land of goshen-rain.and pharaoh-big-house spake unto joseph-add, saying, thy father and thy brethren are come unto thee:the land of mizraim-narrows is before-turns thee; in the best of the land make thy father and brethren to dwell; in the land of goshen-rain let them dwell: and if thou knowest any men of activity among them, then make them rulers over my in-them-animal.and joseph-add brought in jacob-backstreet his father, and set him before-turns pharaoh-big-house: and jacob-backstreet knee-fluffy-blessed pharaoh-big-house.and pharaoh-big-house said unto jacob-backstreet, how old art thou?and jacob-backstreet said unto pharaoh-big-house, the days of the years of my pilgrimage are an hundred and thirty years: few and bad have the days of the years of my life been, and have not attained unto the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage.and jacob-backstreet knee-fluffy-blessed pharaoh-big-house, and went out from before-turns pharaoh-big-house.and joseph-add placed his father and his brethren, and gave them a possession in the land of mizraim-narrows, in the best of the land, in the land of ram-voicelessses-born-by-ra, as pharaoh-big-house had order-prescribed.and joseph-add nourished his father, and his brethren, and all his father's daughter-household, with bread, according to their families.and there was no bread in all the land; for the famine was very sore, so that the land of mizraim-narrows and all the land of canaan-mobile-trade fainted by reason of the famine.and joseph-add added up all the money that was found in the land of mizraim-narrows, and in the land of canaan-mobile-trade, for the corn-swimming which they bought: and joseph-add brought the money into pharaoh-big-house's daughter-house.and when money failed in the land of mizraim-narrows, and in the land of canaan-mobile-trade, all the mizraim-narrowsians came unto joseph-add, and said, give us bread: for why should we die in thy presence? for the money faileth.and joseph-add said, give your in-them-animal; and i will give you for your in-them-animal, if money fail.and they brought their in-them-animal unto joseph-add: and joseph-add gave them bread in exchange for horses, and for the flocks, and for the in-them-animal of the visit-cattles, and for the asses: and he fed them with bread for all their in-them-animal for that year.when that year was ended, they came unto him the second year, and said unto him, we will not hide it from my base-lord, how that our money is spent; my base-lord also hath our visit-cattles of in-them-animal; there is not ought left in the sight of my base-lord, and our bodies, and our lands:wherefore we die before-turns thine eyes, both we and our land? buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be workers unto pharaoh-big-house: and give us seed, that we may live, and not die, that the land be not desolate.and joseph-add bought all the land of mizraim-narrows for pharaoh-big-house; for the mizraim-narrowsians sold every man his field, because the famine prevailed over them: so the land became pharaoh-big-house's.and as for the with-mum-people, he removed them to cities from one end of the borders of mizraim-narrows even to the other end thereof.only the land of the dimmer-servers bought he not; for the dimmer-servers had a portion assigned them of pharaoh-big-house, and did eat their portion which pharaoh-big-house gave them: wherefore they sold not their lands.then joseph-add said unto the with-mum-people, behold, i have bought you this day and your land for pharaoh-big-house: lo, here is seed for you, and ye sow the land.and it come to pass in the increase, that ye give the fifth part unto pharaoh-big-house, and four parts be your own, for seed of the field, and for your food, and for them of your daughter-households, and for food for your little ones.and they said, thou hast saved our lives: let us find attractiveness in the sight of my base-lord, and we will be pharaoh-big-house's workers.and joseph-add made it a teaching over the land of mizraim-narrows unto this day, that pharaoh-big-house should have the fifth part, except the land of the dimmer-servers only, which became not pharaoh-big-house's.and israel-saturated-towards dwelt in the land of mizraim-narrows, in the country of goshen-rain; and they had possessions therein, and grew, and multiplied exceedingly.and jacob-backstreet lived in the land of mizraim-narrows seventeen years: so the whole age of jacob-backstreet was an hundred forty and seven years.and the time drew nigh that israel-saturated-towards must die: and he called his child-between joseph-add, and said unto him, if now i have found attractiveness in thy sight, put, i pray thee, thy hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me; bury me not, i pray thee, in mizraim-narrows:and i will lie with my fathers, and thou carry me out of mizraim-narrows, and bury me in their buryingplace. and he said, i will do as thou hast said.and he said, swear unto me. and he sware unto him. and israel-saturated-towards bowed himself upon the bed's head.and it came to pass after these things, that one told joseph-add, behold, thy father is sick: and he took with him his two children-betweens, manasseh-place-of-sleep and ephraim-fruitful.and one told jacob-backstreet, and said, behold, thy child-between joseph-add cometh unto thee: and israel-saturated-towards strengthened himself, and sat upon the bed.and jacob-backstreet said unto joseph-add, elohim-towards-these almighty appeared unto me at luz-hazel in the land of canaan-mobile-trade, and knee-fluffy-blessed me,and said unto me, behold, i will make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, and i will make of thee a multitude of with-mum-people; and will give this land to thy seed after thee for an everlasting possession.and now thy two children-betweens, ephraim-fruitful and manasseh-place-of-sleep, which were born unto thee in the land of mizraim-narrows before-turns i came unto thee into mizraim-narrows, are mine; as reu-buddyben and simeon-hear-home, they be mine.and thy issue, which thou begettest after them, be thine, and be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance.and as for me, when i came from padan, rachel-ewe died by me in the land of canaan-mobile-trade in the way, when yet there was and a little way to come unto ephrath-wishy-washy: and i buried her there in the way of ephrath-wishy-washy; the same is bethlehem-house-of-bread.and israel-saturated-towards beheld joseph-add's children-betweens, and said, who are these?and joseph-add said unto his father, they are my children-betweens, whom elohim-towards-these hath given me in this place. and he said, bring them, i pray thee, unto me, and i will knee-fluffy-bless them.now the eyes of israel-saturated-towards were dim for age, so that he could not see. and he brought them near unto him; and he kissed them, and embraced them.and israel-saturated-towards said unto joseph-add, i had not thought to see thy face-turns: and, lo, elohim-towards-these hath showed me also thy seed.and joseph-add brought them out from between-bin his knees, and he bowed himself with his face-turns to the earth.and joseph-add took them both, ephraim-fruitful in his right hand toward israel-saturated-towards's left hand, and manasseh-place-of-sleep in his left hand toward israel-saturated-towards's right hand, and brought them near unto him.and israel-saturated-towards stretched out his right hand, and laid it upon ephraim-fruitful's head, who was the younger, and his left hand upon manasseh-place-of-sleep's head, guiding his hands wittingly; for manasseh-place-of-sleep was the firstborn.and he knee-fluffy-blessed joseph-add, and said, elohim-towards-these, before-turns whom my fathers abraham-their-dick and isaac-laughter did walk, the elohim-towards-these which fed me all my life long unto this day,the angel-messanger which redeemed me from all bad, knee-fluffy-bless the lads; and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers abraham-their-dick and isaac-laughter; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth.and when joseph-add saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of ephraim-fruitful, it displeased him: and he held up his father's hand, to remove it from ephraim-fruitful's head unto manasseh-place-of-sleep's head.and joseph-add said unto his father, not so, my father: for this is the firstborn; put thy right hand upon his head.and his father refused, and said, i hand-know it, my child-between, i hand-know it: he also become a with-mum-people, and he also be great: and truly his younger brother be greater than he, and his seed become a multitude of nations.and he knee-fluffy-blessed them that day, saying, in thee israel-saturated-towards knee-fluffy-bless, saying, elohim-towards-these make thee as ephraim-fruitful and as manasseh-place-of-sleep: and he set ephraim-fruitful before-turns manasseh-place-of-sleep.and israel-saturated-towards said unto joseph-add, behold, i die: and elohim-towards-these be with you, and bring you again unto the land of your fathers.moreover i have given to thee one portion above thy brethren, which i took out of the hand of the amorite-talker with my sword and with my bow.and jacob-backstreet called unto his children-betweens, and said, gather yourselves together, that i may tell you that which befall you in the last days.gather yourselves together, and hear, ye children-betweens of jacob-backstreet; and hearken unto israel-saturated-towards your father.reu-buddyben, thou art my firstborn, my might, and the beginning of my strength, the excellency of dignity, and the excellency of dynamic:unstable as from-waters, no excel; because thou wentest up to thy father's bed; then ceasedst thou it: he went up to my couch.simeon-hear-home and levi-join are brethren; instruments of cruelty are in their habitations.o my being, come not thou into their secret; unto their assembly, mine honor, be not thou united: for in their nose-anger they slew a man, and in their self-will they digged down a wall.cursed be their nose-anger, for it was fierce; and their wrath, for it was cruel: i will divide them in jacob-backstreet, and scatter them in israel-saturated-towards.judah-know, thou art he whom thy brethren praise: thy hand be in the neck of thine father-adversaries; thy father's children-betweens bow down before-turns thee.judah-know is a gather-lion's whelp: from the prey, my child-between, thou art gone up: he stooped down, he couched as a gather-lion, and as an old gather-lion; who rouse him up?the sceptre not depart from judah-know, nor a teachinggiver from between-bin his feet, until shiloh-calm come; and unto him the gathering of the with-mum-people be.binding his foal unto the vine, and his ass's colt unto the choice vine; he washed his garments in wine-inherit, and his clothes in the blood of grapes:his eyes be red with wine-inherit, and his teeth to-between-bin-between-build-white with milk.zebulun-fertile dwell at the haven of the sea; and he be for an haven of ships; and his border be unto zidon-side-by-side.issachar-wage is a strong ass couching down between-bin two burdens:and he saw that rest was good, and the land that it was pleasant; and bowed his shoulder to bear, and became a worker unto tribute.dan-discuss decide his with-mum-people, as one of the branchs of israel-saturated-towards.dan-discuss be a serpent by the way, an adder in the path, that biteth the horse heels, so that his rider fall backward.i have waited for thy saving, yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah.gad-luck, a troop overcome him: and he overcome at the last.out of asher-bliss his bread be fat, and he yield royal dainties.naphtali-twisted is a here-hind let loose: he giveth goodly bee-words.joseph-add is a fruitful bough, even a fruitful bough by a well; whose branches run over the wall:the archers have sorely grieved him, and shot at him, and hated him:and his bow abode in strength, and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty elohim-towards-these of jacob-backstreet; (from thence is the shepherd, the father-child-stone of israel-saturated-towards:)even by the elohim-towards-these of thy father, who help thee; and by the almighty, who knee-fluffy-bless thee with knee-fluffy-blessings of namespaces above, knee-fluffy-blessings of the deep that lieth under, knee-fluffy-blessings of the breasts, and of the womb:the knee-fluffy-blessings of thy father have prevailed above the knee-fluffy-blessings of my progenitors unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills: they be on the head of joseph-add, and on the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren.benjamin-he-between-of-righthand evening-raven as a wolf: in the morning he devour the prey, and at night he divide the spoil.all these are the twelve branchs of israel-saturated-towards: and this is it that their father spake unto them, and knee-fluffy-blessed them; every one according to his knee-fluffy-blessing he knee-fluffy-blessed them.and he charged them, and said unto them, i am to be added unto my with-mum-people: bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of ephron-pencil the hittite-cut,in the cave that is in the field of machpelah-copy-product, which is before-turns mamre-see-bitter, in the land of canaan-mobile-trade, which abraham-their-dick bought with the field of ephron-pencil the hittite-cut for a possession of a buryingplace.there they buried abraham-their-dick and sarah-her-soakedness his woman; there they buried isaac-laughter and rebekah-stall his woman; and there i buried leah-tired.the purchase of the field and of the cave that is therein was from children-betweens of heth-bold.and when jacob-backstreet had made an end of order-prescribeing his children-betweens, he added up his feet into the bed, and yielded up the breath-spirit, and was added unto his with-mum-people.and joseph-add fell upon his father's face-turns, and wept upon him, and kissed him.and joseph-add order-prescribed his workers the physicians to embalm his father: and the physicians embalmed israel-saturated-towards.and forty days were fulfilled for him; for so are fulfilled the days of those which are embalmed: and the mizraim-narrowsians mourned for him threescore and ten days.and when the days of his mourning were past, joseph-add spake unto the daughter-house of pharaoh-big-house, saying, if now i have found attractiveness in your eyes, speak, i pray you, in the ears of pharaoh-big-house, saying,my father made me swear, saying, lo, i die: in my grave which i have digged for me in the land of canaan-mobile-trade, there thou bury me. now therefore let me go up, i pray thee, and bury my father, and i will come again.and pharaoh-big-house said, go up, and bury thy father, according as he made thee swear.and joseph-add went up to bury his father: and with him went up all the workers of pharaoh-big-house, the elders of his daughter-house, and all the elders of the land of mizraim-narrows,and all the daughter-house of joseph-add, and his brethren, and his father's daughter-house: only their little ones, and their flocks, and their visit-cattles, they left in the land of goshen-rain.and there went up with him both chariots and horsemen: and it was a very great company.and they came to the threshingfloor of atad, which is beyond jordan-its-going-down, and there they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation: and he made a mourning for his father seven days.and when the inhabitants of the land, the canaan-mobile-tradeites, saw the mourning in the floor of atad, they said, this is a grievous mourning to the mizraim-narrowsians: wherefore the name of it was called abel-vapormizraim, which is beyond jordan-its-going-down.and his children-betweens did unto him according as he order-prescribed them:for his children-betweens carried him into the land of canaan-mobile-trade, and buried him in the cave of the field of machpelah-copy-product, which abraham-their-dick bought with the field for a possession of a buryingplace of ephron-pencil the hittite-cut, before-turns mamre-see-bitter.and joseph-add returned into mizraim-narrows, he, and his brethren, and all that went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father.and when joseph-add's brethren saw that their father was dead, they said, joseph-add will peradventure hate us, and will certainly requite us all the bad which we did unto him.and they sent a messenger unto joseph-add, saying, thy father did order-prescribe before-turns he died, saying,so ye say unto joseph-add, forgive, i pray thee now, the fire-name of thy brethren, and their miss; for they did unto thee bad: and now, we pray thee, forgive the fire-name of the workers of the elohim-towards-these of thy father. and joseph-add wept when they spake unto him.and his brethren also went and fell down before-turns his face-turns; and they said, behold, we be thy workers.and joseph-add said unto them, fear not: for am i in the place of elohim-towards-these?and as for you, ye thought bad against me; and elohim-towards-these meant it unto good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save much with-mum-people alive.now therefore fear ye not: i will nourish you, and your little ones. and he comforted them, and spake kindly unto them.and joseph-add dwelt in mizraim-narrows, he, and his father's daughter-house: and joseph-add lived an hundred and ten years.and joseph-add saw ephraim-fruitful's children-betweens of the third generation: children-betweens also of machi-of-beatr-recognize child-between of manasseh-place-of-sleep were brought up upon joseph-add's knees.and joseph-add said unto his brethren, i die: and elohim-towards-these will surely visit you, and bring you out of this land unto the land which he sware to abraham-their-dick, to isaac-laughter, and to jacob-backstreet.and joseph-add took an toward-oath of children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards, saying, elohim-towards-these will surely visit you, and ye carry up my bones from hence.so joseph-add died, being an hundred and ten years old: and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in mizraim-narrows.now these are the names of children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards, which came into mizraim-narrows; every man and his daughter-household came with jacob-backstreet.reu-buddyben, simeon-hear-home, levi-join, and judah-know,issachar-wage, zebulun-fertile, and benjamin-he-between-of-righthand,dan-discuss, and naphtali-twisted, gad-luck, and asher-bliss.and all the beings that came out of the loins of jacob-backstreet were seventy beings: for joseph-add was in mizraim-narrows already.and joseph-add died, and all his brethren, and all that generation.and children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and waxed exceeding mighty; and the land was filled with them.now there arose up a new moloch-king over mizraim-narrows, which hand-knew not joseph-add.and he said unto his with-mum-people, behold, the with-mum-people of children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards are more and mightier than we:come on, let us deal wisely with them; lest they multiply, and it come to pass, that, when there falleth out any war, they join also unto our father-adversaries, and fight against us, and so get them up out of the land.therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with their burdens. and they between-built for pharaoh-big-house treasure cities, pithom and raamses.and the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew. and they were grieved because of children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards.and the mizraim-narrowsians made children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards to work for with rigor:and they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in mortar, and in brick-l-between, and in all manner of work in the field: all their work, wherein they made them work for, was with rigor.and the moloch-king of mizraim-narrows spake to the hebrew-cross-over midwives, of which the name of the one was shiphrah-book-cow, and the name of the other pua-beautyh-cry:and he said, when ye do the office of a midwife to the hebrew-cross-over women, and see them upon the stools; if it be a child-between, then ye kill him: and if it be a daughter-hoof-bat-child, then she live.and the midwives feared elohim-towards-these, and did not as the moloch-king of mizraim-narrows order-prescribed them, and saved the men children-betweens alive.and the moloch-king of mizraim-narrows called for the midwives, and said unto them, why have ye done this thing, and have saved the men children-betweens alive?and the midwives said unto pharaoh-big-house, because the hebrew-cross-over women are not as the mizraim-narrowsian women; for they are lively, and are delivered ere the midwives come in unto them.therefore elohim-towards-these dealt well with the midwives: and the with-mum-people multiplied, and waxed very mighty.and it came to pass, because the midwives feared elohim-towards-these, that he made them daughter-houses.and pharaoh-big-house charged all his with-mum-people, saying, every child-between that is born ye cast into the river, and every daughter-hoof-bat-child ye save alive.and there went a man of the daughter-house of levi-join, and took to woman a daughter-hoof-bat-child of levi-join.and the woman conceived, and conceived-of a child-between: and when she saw him that he was a goodly child, she hid him three months.and when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an cabinet of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and put child therein; and she laid it in the flags by the river's brink.and his sister stood afar off, to wit what would be done to him.and the daughter-hoof-bat-child of pharaoh-big-house came down to wash herself at the river; and her maidens walked along by the river's side; and when she saw the cabinet among the flags, she sent her maid to fetch it.and when she had opened it, she saw child: and, behold, the babe wept. and she had compassion on him, and said, this is one of the hebrew-cross-overs' children-betweens.then said his sister to pharaoh-big-house's daughter-hoof-bat-child, i go and call to thee a nurse of the hebrew-cross-over women, that she may nurse child for thee?and pharaoh-big-house's daughter-hoof-bat-child said to her, go. and the maid went and called child's mother.and pharaoh-big-house's daughter-hoof-bat-child said unto her, take this child away, and nurse it for me, and i will give thee thy wages. and the women took child, and nursed it.and child grew, and she brought him unto pharaoh-big-house's daughter-hoof-bat-child, and he became her child-between. and she called his name mose-extracted: and she said, because i drew him out of the from-waters.and it came to pass in those days, when mose-extracted was grown, that he went out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens: and he spied an mizraim-narrowsian smiting an hebrew-cross-over, one of his brethren.and he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there was no man, he slew the mizraim-narrowsian, and hid him in the sand.and when he went out the second day, behold, two men of the hebrew-cross-overs strove together: and he said to him that did the wrong, wherefore hitst thou thy fellow?and he said, who made thee a prince and a decide over us? intendest thou to kill me, as thou killedst the mizraim-narrowsian? and mose-extracted feared, and said, surely this thing is hand-known.now when pharaoh-big-house heard this thing, he sought to slay mose-extracted. and mose-extracted fled from the face-turns of pharaoh-big-house, and dwelt in the land of midian-place-of-discussed-teaching: and he sat down by a well.now the dimmer-server of midian-place-of-discussed-teaching had seven children-betweenesss: and they came and drew from-waters, and filled the troughs to from-waters their father's flock.and the shepherds came and drove them away: and mose-extracted stood up and helped them, and watered their flock.and when they came to reu-buddyel their father, he said, how is it that ye are come so soon to day?and they said, an mizraim-narrowsian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and also drew from-waters enough for us, and watered the flock.and he said unto his children-betweenesss, and where is he? why is it that ye have left the man? call him, that he may eat bread.and mose-extracted was content to dwell with the man: and he gave mose-extracted zipor-birdah-bird his daughter-hoof-bat-child.and she conceived-of him a child-between, and he called his name gershom-stranger: for he said, i have been a stranger in a strange land.and it came to pass in process of time, that the moloch-king of mizraim-narrows died: and children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards sighed by reason of the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up unto elohim-towards-these by reason of the bondage.and elohim-towards-these heard their groaning, and elohim-towards-these remembered his covenant with abraham-their-dick, with isaac-laughter, and with jacob-backstreet.and elohim-towards-these looked upon children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards, and elohim-towards-these had respect unto them.now mose-extracted kept the flock of jethro-look his father in law, the dimmer-server of midian-place-of-discussed-teaching: and he led the flock to the backside of the place-of-word-desert, and came to the mountain of elohim-towards-these, even to horeb-sword.and the angel-messanger of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush: and he looked, and, behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed.and mose-extracted said, i will now turn aside, and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt.and when yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah saw that he turned aside to see, elohim-towards-these called unto him out of the midst of the bush, and said, mose-extracted, mose-extracted. and he said, here am i.and he said, draw not nigh hither: put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is dedicated-finished ground.moreover he said, i am the elohim-towards-these of thy father, the elohim-towards-these of abraham-their-dick, the elohim-towards-these of isaac-laughter, and the elohim-towards-these of jacob-backstreet. and mose-extracted hid his face-turns; for he was afraid to look upon elohim-towards-these.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah said, i have surely seen the affliction of my with-mum-people which are in mizraim-narrows, and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters; for i hand-know their sorrows;and i am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the mizraim-narrowsians, and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large, unto a land flowing with milk and honey; unto the place of the canaan-mobile-tradeites, and the hittite-cuts-tusk, and the amorite-talkers, and the perizzite-unwalleds, and the hivite-experiences, and the jebusite-tramplers.now therefore, behold, the cry of children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards is come unto me: and i have also seen the oppression wherewith the mizraim-narrowsians oppress them.come now therefore, and i will send thee unto pharaoh-big-house, that thou mayest bring forth my with-mum-people children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards out of mizraim-narrows.and mose-extracted said unto elohim-towards-these, who am i, that i should go unto pharaoh-big-house, and that i should bring forth children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards out of mizraim-narrows?and he said, certainly i will be with thee; and this be a token unto thee, that i have sent thee: when thou hast brought forth the with-mum-people out of mizraim-narrows, ye work for elohim-towards-these upon this mountain.and mose-extracted said unto elohim-towards-these, behold, when i come unto children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards, and say unto them, the elohim-towards-these of your fathers hath sent me unto you; and they say to me, what is his name? what i say unto them?and elohim-towards-these said unto mose-extracted, i am that i am: and he said, thus thou say unto children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards, i am hath sent me unto you.and elohim-towards-these said moreover unto mose-extracted, thus thou say unto children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards, yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah elohim-towards-these of your fathers, the elohim-towards-these of abraham-their-dick, the elohim-towards-these of isaac-laughter, and the elohim-towards-these of jacob-backstreet, hath sent me unto you: this is my name for ever, and this is my memorial unto all generations.go, and gather the elders of israel-saturated-towards together, and say unto them, yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah elohim-towards-these of your fathers, the elohim-towards-these of abraham-their-dick, of isaac-laughter, and of jacob-backstreet, appeared unto me, saying, i have surely visited you, and seen that which is done to you in mizraim-narrows:and i have said, i will bring you up out of the affliction of mizraim-narrows unto the land of the canaan-mobile-tradeites, and the hittite-cuts-tusk, and the amorite-talkers, and the perizzite-unwalleds, and the hivite-experiences, and the jebusite-tramplers, unto a land flowing with milk and honey.and they hearken to thy voice: and thou come, thou and the elders of israel-saturated-towards, unto the moloch-king of mizraim-narrows, and ye say unto him, yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah elohim-towards-these of the hebrew-cross-overs hath met with us: and now let us go, we beseech thee, three days' journey into the place-of-word-desert, that we may butcher to yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah our elohim-towards-these.and i am sure that the moloch-king of mizraim-narrows will not let you go, no, not by a mighty hand.and i will stretch out my hand, and hit mizraim-narrows with all my wonders which i will do in the midst thereof: and after that he will let you go.and i will give this with-mum-people favor in the sight of the mizraim-narrowsians: and it come to pass, that, when ye go, ye not go empty.and every woman borrow of her neighbor, and of her that sojourneth in her daughter-house, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment: and ye put them upon your children-betweens, and upon your children-betweenesss; and ye spoil the mizraim-narrowsians.and mose-extracted answered and said, and, behold, they will not be coached by me, nor hearken unto my voice: for they will say, yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah hath not appeared unto thee.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah said unto him, what is that in thine hand? and he said, a pen.and he said, cast it on the ground. and he cast it on the ground, and it became a serpent; and mose-extracted fled from before-turns it.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah said unto mose-extracted, put forth thine hand, and take it by the tail. and he put forth his hand, and caught it, and it became a pen in his hand:that they may be coached by that yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah elohim-towards-these of their fathers, the elohim-towards-these of abraham-their-dick, the elohim-towards-these of isaac-laughter, and the elohim-towards-these of jacob-backstreet, hath appeared unto thee.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah said furthermore unto him, put now thine hand into thy bosom. and he put his hand into his bosom: and when he took it out, behold, his hand was speckled-waspish-speckled as snow.and he said, put thine hand into thy bosom again. and he put his hand into his bosom again; and plucked it out of his bosom, and, behold, it was turned again as his other flesh.and it come to pass, if they will not be coached by thee, neither hearken to the voice of the first sign, that they will be coached by the voice of the latter sign.and it come to pass, if they will not be coached by also these two signs, neither hearken unto thy voice, that thou take of the from-waters of the river, and pour it upon the dry land: and the from-waters which thou takest out of the river become blood upon the dry land.and mose-extracted said unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, o my yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, i am not eloquent, neither heretofore, nor since thou hast bee-spoken unto thy worker: and i am slow of speech, and of a slow tongue.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah said unto him, who hath made man's mouth? or who maketh the dumb, or deaf, or the seeing, or the blind? have not i yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah?now therefore go, and i will be with thy mouth, and teach thee what thou say.and he said, o my yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, send, i pray thee, by the hand of him whom thou wilt send.and the nose-anger of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah was kindled against mose-extracted, and he said, is not aaron-cabinet the levi-jointe thy brother? i hand-know that he can speak well. and also, behold, he cometh forth to until-witness thee: and when he seeth thee, he will be glad in his heart.and thou speak unto him, and put bee-words in his mouth: and i will be with thy mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you what ye do.and he be thy spokesman unto the with-mum-people: and he be, even he be to thee instead of a mouth, and thou be to him instead of elohim-towards-these.and thou take this pen in thine hand, wherewith thou do signs.and mose-extracted went and returned to jethro-look his father in law, and said unto him, let me go, i pray thee, and return unto my brethren which are in mizraim-narrows, and see whether they be yet alive. and jethro-look said to mose-extracted, go in peace.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah said unto mose-extracted in midian-place-of-discussed-teaching, go, return into mizraim-narrows: for all the men are dead which sought thy life.and mose-extracted took his woman and his children-betweens, and set them upon an ass, and he returned to the land of mizraim-narrows: and mose-extracted took the pen of elohim-towards-these in his hand.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah said unto mose-extracted, when thou goest to return into mizraim-narrows, see that thou do all those wonders before-turns pharaoh-big-house, which i have put in thine hand: and i will harden his heart, that he not let the with-mum-people go.and thou say unto pharaoh-big-house, thus saith yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, israel-saturated-towards is my child-between, even my firstborn:and i say unto thee, let my child-between go, that he may work for me: and if thou refuse to let him go, behold, i will slay thy child-between, even thy firstborn.and it came to pass by the way in the inn, that yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah met him, and sought to kill him.then zipor-birdah-bird took a sharp father-child-stone, and cut off the foreskin of her child-between, and cast it at his feet, and said, surely a bloody man art thou to me.so he let him go: then she said, a bloody man thou art, because of the script-circumcision.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah said to aaron-cabinet, go into the place-of-word-desert to until-witness mose-extracted. and he went, and met him in the mount of elohim-towards-these, and kissed him.and mose-extracted told aaron-cabinet all the bee-words of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah who had sent him, and all the signs which he had order-prescribed him.and mose-extracted and aaron-cabinet went and added together all the elders of children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards:and aaron-cabinet spake all the bee-words which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah had bee-spoken unto mose-extracted, and did the signs in the sight of the with-mum-people.and the with-mum-people was coached by: and when they heard that yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah had visited children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards, and that he had looked upon their affliction, then they bowed their heads and partook-shatakh.and afterward mose-extracted and aaron-cabinet went in, and told pharaoh-big-house, thus saith yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah elohim-towards-these of israel-saturated-towards, let my with-mum-people go, that they may hold a until-conception unto me in the place-of-word-desert.and pharaoh-big-house said, who is yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, that i should obey his voice to let israel-saturated-towards go? i hand-know not yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, neither will i let israel-saturated-towards go.and they said, the elohim-towards-these of the hebrew-cross-overs hath met with us: let us go, we pray thee, three days' journey into the place-of-word-desert, and butcher unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah our elohim-towards-these; lest he fall upon us with word-bee, or with the sword.and the moloch-king of mizraim-narrows said unto them, wherefore do ye, mose-extracted and aaron-cabinet, let the with-mum-people from their works? get you unto your burdens.and pharaoh-big-house said, behold, the with-mum-people of the land now are many, and ye make them rest from their burdens.and pharaoh-big-house order-prescribed the same day the taskmasters of the with-mum-people, and their officers, saying,ye no more give the with-mum-people straw-t-between to make brick-l-between, as heretofore: let them go and gather straw-t-between for themselves.and the tale of the brick-l-betweens, which they did make heretofore, ye lay upon them; ye not diminish ought thereof: for they be idle; therefore they cry, saying, let us go and butcher to our elohim-towards-these.let there more work be laid upon the men, that they may labor therein; and let them not regard vain bee-words.and the taskmasters of the with-mum-people went out, and their officers, and they spake to the with-mum-people, saying, thus saith pharaoh-big-house, i will not give you straw-t-between.go ye, get you straw-t-between where ye can find it: yet not ought of your work be diminished.so the with-mum-people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of mizraim-narrows to gather stubble instead of straw-t-between.and the taskmasters hasted them, saying, fulfil your works, your daily tasks, as when there was straw-t-between.and the officers of children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards, which pharaoh-big-house's taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, and demanded, wherefore have ye not fulfilled your task in making brick-l-between both yesterday and to day, as heretofore?then the officers of children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards came and cried unto pharaoh-big-house, saying, wherefore dealest thou thus with thy workers?there is no straw-t-between given unto thy workers, and they say to us, make brick-l-between: and, behold, thy workers are beaten; and the fault is in thine own with-mum-people.and he said, ye are idle, ye are idle: therefore ye say, let us go and do butcher to yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah.go therefore now, and work; for there no straw-t-between be given you, yet ye deliver the tale of brick-l-betweens.and the officers of children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards did see that they were in bad case, after it was said, ye not minish ought from your brick-l-betweens of your daily task.and they met mose-extracted and aaron-cabinet, who stood in the way, as they came forth from pharaoh-big-house:and they said unto them, yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah look upon you, and decide; because ye have made our savor to be crave-abhorred in the eyes of pharaoh-big-house, and in the eyes of his workers, to put a sword in their hand to slay us.and mose-extracted returned unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, and said, my base-lord, wherefore hast thou so bad entreated this with-mum-people? why is it that thou hast sent me?for since i came to pharaoh-big-house to speak in thy name, he hath done bad to this with-mum-people; neither hast thou delivered thy with-mum-people at all.then yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah said unto mose-extracted, now thou see what i will do to pharaoh-big-house: for with a strong hand he let them go, and with a strong hand he drive them out of his land.and elohim-towards-these spake unto mose-extracted, and said unto him, i am yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah:and i appeared unto abraham-their-dick, unto isaac-laughter, and unto jacob-backstreet, by the name of elohim-towards-these almighty, and by my name yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah was i not hand-known to them.and i have also established my covenant with them, to give them the land of canaan-mobile-trade, the land of their pilgrimage, wherein they were strangers.and i have also heard the groaning of children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards, whom the mizraim-narrowsians keep in bondage; and i have remembered my covenant.wherefore say unto children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards, i am yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, and i will bring you out from under the burdens of the mizraim-narrowsians, and i will rid you out of their bondage, and i will redeem you with a stretched out arm, and with great decision-grammars:and i will take you to me for a with-mum-people, and i will be to you a elohim-towards-these: and ye hand-know that i am yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah your elohim-towards-these, which bringeth you out from under the burdens of the mizraim-narrowsians.and i will bring you in unto the land, concerning the which i did swear to give it to abraham-their-dick, to isaac-laughter, and to jacob-backstreet; and i will give it you for an heritage: i am yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah.and mose-extracted spake so unto children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards: and they hearkened not unto mose-extracted for anguish of breath-spirit, and for cruel bondage.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah spake unto mose-extracted, saying,go in, speak unto pharaoh-big-house moloch-king of mizraim-narrows, that he let children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards go out of his land.and mose-extracted spake before-turns yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, saying, behold, children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards have not hearkened unto me; how then pharaoh-big-house hear me, who am of foreskinned lips?and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah spake unto mose-extracted and unto aaron-cabinet, and gave them a charge unto children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards, and unto pharaoh-big-house moloch-king of mizraim-narrows, to bring children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards out of the land of mizraim-narrows.these be the heads of their fathers' daughter-houses: children-betweens of reu-buddyben the firstborn of israel-saturated-towards; hanoch-educated, and pallu-wonder, hezron-courtyard, and carmi-my-wine-inherityard: these be the families of reu-buddyben.and children-betweens of simeon-hear-home; towards-his-sea, and jamin-righthand, and ohad-one, and jachin-prepare, and zohar-bleach, and shaul-lent child-between of a canaan-mobile-tradeitish woman: these are the families of simeon-hear-home.and these are the names of children-betweens of levi-join according to their generations; gershon-drive-out, and kohath-obedient-hope, and merari-bitter: and the years of the life of levi-join were an hundred thirty and seven years.children-betweens of gershon-drive-out; libni-to-build-my-white, and shimi-my-hearing, according to their families.and children-betweens of kohath-obedient-hope; amram-people-high, and izhar-aperture, and hebron-friend-joy, and uz-gooseziel: and the years of the life of kohath-obedient-hope were an hundred thirty and three years.and children-betweens of merari-bitter; makhali-my-pardon and mushi-my-draw: these are the families of levi-join according to their generations.and amram-people-high took him jochebed-made-heavy his father's sister to woman; and she conceived-of him aaron-cabinet and mose-extracted: and the years of the life of amram-people-high were an hundred and thirty and seven years.and children-betweens of izhar-aperture; korah-bald-ice, and nepheg-expired, and zichri-my-rememberer.and children-betweens of uz-gooseziel; mishael-towards-poll, and elzaphan-towards-cipher, and zithri-my-secret.and aaron-cabinet took him elisheba-my-towards-seven, daughter-hoof-bat-child of aminadab-my-people-contribute, sister of naashon-guess-snake, to woman; and she conceived-of him nadab-volunteer, and abihu-he-my-pa, eleazar-towards-stop, and itamar-with-palm.and children-betweens of korah-bald-ice; assir-prisoner, and elkanah-towards-buy, and abiasaph-my-father-collects: these are the families of the korhites-bald-ice.and eleazar-towards-stop aaron-cabinet's child-between took him one of children-betweenesss of putiel-my-open-towards to woman; and she conceived-of him pinehas-mouth-attempt: these are the heads of the fathers of the levi-jointes according to their families.these are that aaron-cabinet and mose-extracted, to whom yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah said, bring out children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards from the land of mizraim-narrows according to their troop-clusters.these are they which spake to pharaoh-big-house moloch-king of mizraim-narrows, to bring out children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards from mizraim-narrows: these are that mose-extracted and aaron-cabinet.and it came to pass on the day when yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah spake unto mose-extracted in the land of mizraim-narrows,that yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah spake unto mose-extracted, saying, i am yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah: speak thou unto pharaoh-big-house moloch-king of mizraim-narrows all that i say unto thee.and mose-extracted said before-turns yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, behold, i am of foreskinned lips, and how pharaoh-big-house hearken unto me?and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah said unto mose-extracted, see, i have made thee a elohim-towards-these to pharaoh-big-house: and aaron-cabinet thy brother be thy bringer.thou speak all that i order-prescribe thee: and aaron-cabinet thy brother speak unto pharaoh-big-house, that he send children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards out of his land.and i will harden pharaoh-big-house's heart, and multiply my signs and my wonders in the land of mizraim-narrows.and pharaoh-big-house not hearken unto you, that i may lay my hand upon mizraim-narrows, and bring forth mine troop-clusters, and my with-mum-people children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards, out of the land of mizraim-narrows by great decision-grammars.and the mizraim-narrowsians hand-know that i am yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, when i stretch forth mine hand upon mizraim-narrows, and bring out children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards from inward them.and mose-extracted and aaron-cabinet did as yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah order-prescribed them, so did they.and mose-extracted was fourscore years old, and aaron-cabinet fourscore and three years old, when they spake unto pharaoh-big-house.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah spake unto mose-extracted and unto aaron-cabinet, saying,when pharaoh-big-house speak unto you, saying, show a miracle for you: then thou say unto aaron-cabinet, take thy pen, and cast it before-turns pharaoh-big-house, and it become a serpent.and mose-extracted and aaron-cabinet went in unto pharaoh-big-house, and they did so as yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah had order-prescribed: and aaron-cabinet cast down his pen before-turns pharaoh-big-house, and before-turns his workers, and it became a serpent.then pharaoh-big-house also called the wise men and the sorcerers: now the magicians of mizraim-narrows, they also did in like manner with their enchantments.for they cast down every man his pen, and they became serpents: and aaron-cabinet's pen swallowed up their pens.and he hardened pharaoh-big-house's heart, that he hearkened not unto them; as yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah had said.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah said unto mose-extracted, pharaoh-big-house's heart is hardened, he refuseth to let the with-mum-people go.get thee unto pharaoh-big-house in the morning; lo, he goeth out unto the from-waters; and thou stand by the river's brink against he come; and the pen which was turned to a serpent thou take in thine hand.and thou say unto him, yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah elohim-towards-these of the hebrew-cross-overs hath sent me unto thee, saying, let my with-mum-people go, that they may work for me in the place-of-word-desert: and, behold, hitherto thou wouldest not hear.thus saith yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, in this thou hand-know that i am yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah: behold, i will hit with the pen that is in mine hand upon the from-waters which are in the river, and they be turned to blood.and the fish that is in the river die, and the river stink; and the mizraim-narrowsians loathe to drink of the from-waters of the river.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah spake unto mose-extracted, say unto aaron-cabinet, take thy pen, and stretch out thine hand upon the from-waters of mizraim-narrows, upon their streams, upon their rivers, and upon their ponds, and upon all their pools of from-waters, that they may become blood; and that there may be blood throughout all the land of mizraim-narrows, both in tools of wood, and in tools of father-child-stone.and mose-extracted and aaron-cabinet did so, as yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah order-prescribed; and he lifted up the pen, and smote the from-waters that were in the river, in the sight of pharaoh-big-house, and in the sight of his workers; and all the from-waters that were in the river were turned to blood.and the fish that was in the river died; and the river stank, and the mizraim-narrowsians could not drink of the from-waters of the river; and there was blood throughout all the land of mizraim-narrows.and the magicians of mizraim-narrows did so with their enchantments: and pharaoh-big-house's heart was hardened, neither did he hearken unto them; as yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah had said.and pharaoh-big-house turned and went into his daughter-house, neither did he set his heart to this also.and all the mizraim-narrowsians digged round about the river for from-waters to drink; for they could not drink of the from-waters of the river.and seven days were fulfilled, after that yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah had smitten the river.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah spake unto mose-extracted, go unto pharaoh-big-house, and say unto him, thus saith yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, let my with-mum-people go, that they may work for me.and if thou refuse to let them go, behold, i will hit all thy borders with frogs:and the river bring forth frogs abundantly, which go up and come into thine daughter-house, and into thy bedchamber, and upon thy bed, and into the daughter-house of thy workers, and upon thy with-mum-people, and into thine ovens, and into thy kneadingtroughs:and the frogs come up both on thee, and upon thy with-mum-people, and upon all thy workers.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah spake unto mose-extracted, say unto aaron-cabinet, stretch forth thine hand with thy pen over the streams, over the rivers, and over the ponds, and cause frogs to come up upon the land of mizraim-narrows.and aaron-cabinet stretched out his hand over the from-waters of mizraim-narrows; and the frogs came up, and covered the land of mizraim-narrows.and the magicians did so with their enchantments, and brought up frogs upon the land of mizraim-narrows.then pharaoh-big-house called for mose-extracted and aaron-cabinet, and said, entreat yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, that he may take away the frogs from me, and from my with-mum-people; and i will let the with-mum-people go, that they may do butcher unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah.and mose-extracted said unto pharaoh-big-house, heaviness over me: when i entreat for thee, and for thy workers, and for thy with-mum-people, to destroy the frogs from thee and thy daughter-houses, that they may remain in the river only?and he said, to morrow. and he said, be it according to thy bee-word: that thou mayest hand-know that there is none like unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah our elohim-towards-these.and the frogs depart from thee, and from thy daughter-houses, and from thy workers, and from thy with-mum-people; they remain in the river only.and mose-extracted and aaron-cabinet went out from pharaoh-big-house: and mose-extracted cried unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah because of the frogs which he had brought against pharaoh-big-house.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah did according to the bee-word of mose-extracted; and the frogs died out of the daughter-houses, out of the villages, and out of the fields.and they added them together upon heaps: and the land stank.and when pharaoh-big-house saw that there was respite, he hardened his heart, and hearkened not unto them; as yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah had said.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah said unto mose-extracted, say unto aaron-cabinet, stretch out thy pen, and hit the dust of the land, that it may become lice throughout all the land of mizraim-narrows.and they did so; for aaron-cabinet stretched out his hand with his pen, and smote the dust of the earth, and it became lice in man, and in beast; all the dust of the land became lice throughout all the land of mizraim-narrows.and the magicians did so with their enchantments to bring forth lice, and they could not: so there were lice upon man, and upon beast.then the magicians said unto pharaoh-big-house, this is the finger of elohim-towards-these: and pharaoh-big-house's heart was hardened, and he hearkened not unto them; as yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah had said.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah said unto mose-extracted, rise up early in the morning, and stand before-turns pharaoh-big-house; lo, he cometh forth to the from-waters; and say unto him, thus saith yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, let my with-mum-people go, that they may work for me.else, if thou wilt not let my with-mum-people go, behold, i will send swarms of flies upon thee, and upon thy workers, and upon thy with-mum-people, and into thy daughter-houses: and the daughter-houses of the mizraim-narrowsians be full of swarms of flies, and also the ground whereon they are.and i will sever in that day the land of goshen-rain, in which my with-mum-people dwell, that no swarms of flies be there; to the end thou mayest hand-know that i am yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah in the midst of the earth.and i will put a division between-bin my with-mum-people and thy with-mum-people: to morrow this sign be.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah did so; and there came a grievous swarm of flies into the daughter-house of pharaoh-big-house, and into his workers' daughter-houses, and into all the land of mizraim-narrows: the land was corrupted by reason of the swarm of flies.and pharaoh-big-house called for mose-extracted and for aaron-cabinet, and said, go ye, butcher to your elohim-towards-these in the land.and mose-extracted said, it is not until-witness so to do; for we butcher the abomination of the mizraim-narrowsians to yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah our elohim-towards-these: lo, we butcher the abomination of the mizraim-narrowsians before-turns their eyes, and will they not father-child-stone us?we will go three days' journey into the place-of-word-desert, and butcher to yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah our elohim-towards-these, as he order-prescribe us.and pharaoh-big-house said, i will let you go, that ye may butcher to yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah your elohim-towards-these in the place-of-word-desert; only ye not go very far away: entreat for me.and mose-extracted said, behold, i go out from thee, and i will entreat yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah that the swarms of flies may depart from pharaoh-big-house, from his workers, and from his with-mum-people, to morrow: and let not pharaoh-big-house deal deceitfully any more in not letting the with-mum-people go to butcher to yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah.and mose-extracted went out from pharaoh-big-house, and entreated yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah did according to the bee-word of mose-extracted; and he removed the swarms of flies from pharaoh-big-house, from his workers, and from his with-mum-people; there remained not one.and pharaoh-big-house hardened his heart at this time also, neither would he let the with-mum-people go.then yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah said unto mose-extracted, go in unto pharaoh-big-house, and tell him, thus saith yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah elohim-towards-these of the hebrew-cross-overs, let my with-mum-people go, that they may work for me.for if thou refuse to let them go, and wilt hold them still,behold, the hand of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah is upon thy in-them-animal which is in the field, upon the horses, upon the asses, upon the ripen-camels, upon the wall-oxen, and upon the sheep: there be a very grievous murrain.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah sever between-bin the in-them-animal of israel-saturated-towards and the in-them-animal of mizraim-narrows: and there nothing die of all that is children-betweens's of israel-saturated-towards.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah appointed a set time, saying, to morrow yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah do this thing in the land.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah did that thing on the morrow, and all the in-them-animal of mizraim-narrows died: and of the in-them-animal of children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards died not one.and pharaoh-big-house sent, and, behold, there was not one of the in-them-animal of the israel-saturated-towardsites dead. and the heart of pharaoh-big-house was hardened, and he did not let the with-mum-people go.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah said unto mose-extracted and unto aaron-cabinet, take to you handfuls of ashes of the furnace, and let mose-extracted sprinkle it toward the namespaces in the sight of pharaoh-big-house.and it become small dust in all the land of mizraim-narrows, and be a grace-boil breaking forth with blains upon man, and upon beast, throughout all the land of mizraim-narrows.and they took ashes of the furnace, and stood before-turns pharaoh-big-house; and mose-extracted sprinkled it up toward namespaces; and it became a grace-boil breaking forth with blains upon man, and upon beast.and the magicians could not stand before-turns mose-extracted because of the grace-boils; for the grace-boil was upon the magicians, and upon all the mizraim-narrowsians.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah hardened the heart of pharaoh-big-house, and he hearkened not unto them; as yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah had bee-spoken unto mose-extracted.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah said unto mose-extracted, rise up early in the morning, and stand before-turns pharaoh-big-house, and say unto him, thus saith yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah elohim-towards-these of the hebrew-cross-overs, let my with-mum-people go, that they may work for me.for i will at this time send all my plagues upon thine heart, and upon thy workers, and upon thy with-mum-people; that thou mayest hand-know that there is none like me in all the earth.for now i will stretch out my hand, that i may hit thee and thy with-mum-people with pestilence; and thou be cut off from the earth.and in very deed for this cause have i raised thee up, for to show in thee my dynamic; and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth.as yet exaltest thou thyself against my with-mum-people, that thou wilt not let them go?behold, to morrow about this time i will cause it to rain a very grievous hail, such as hath not been in mizraim-narrows since the foundation thereof even until now.send therefore now, and gather thy in-them-animal, and all that thou hast in the field; for upon every man and beast which be found in the field, and not be brought home, the hail come down upon them, and they die.he that feared the bee-word of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah among the workers of pharaoh-big-house made his workers and his in-them-animal flee into the daughter-houses:and he that regarded not the bee-word of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah left his workers and his in-them-animal in the field.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah said unto mose-extracted, stretch forth thine hand toward namespaces, that there may be hail in all the land of mizraim-narrows, upon man, and upon beast, and upon every herb of the field, throughout the land of mizraim-narrows.and mose-extracted stretched forth his pen toward namespaces: and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah sent thunder and hail, and the fire ran along upon the ground; and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah rained hail upon the land of mizraim-narrows.so there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, very grievous, such as there was none like it in all the land of mizraim-narrows since it became a nation.and the hail smote throughout all the land of mizraim-narrows all that was in the field, both man and beast; and the hail smote every herb of the field, and brake every tree of the field.only in the land of goshen-rain, where children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards were, was there no hail.and pharaoh-big-house sent, and called for mose-extracted and aaron-cabinet, and said unto them, i have missed this time: yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah is just, and i and my with-mum-people are wicked.entreat yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah (for it is enough) that there be no more mighty thunderings and hail; and i will let you go, and ye stay no longer.and mose-extracted said unto him, as soon as i am gone out of the light-city, i will spread abroad my hands unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah; and the thunder cease, neither there be any more hail; that thou mayest hand-know how that the earth is yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah's.and as for thee and thy workers, i hand-know that ye will not yet fear yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah elohim-towards-these.and the flax and the gates-barley was smitten: for the gates-barley was in the ear, and the flax was bolled.and the wheat and the rye were not smitten: for they were not grown up.and mose-extracted went out of the light-city from pharaoh-big-house, and spread abroad his hands unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah: and the thunders and hail ceased, and the rain was not poured upon the earth.and when pharaoh-big-house saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders were ceased, he missed yet more, and hardened his heart, he and his workers.and the heart of pharaoh-big-house was hardened, neither would he let children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards go; as yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah had bee-spoken by mose-extracted.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah said unto mose-extracted, go in unto pharaoh-big-house: for i have hardened his heart, and the heart of his workers, that i might show these my signs before-turns him:and that thou mayest tell in the ears of thy child-between, and of thy child-between's child-between, what things i have wrought in mizraim-narrows, and my signs which i have done among them; that ye may hand-know how that i am yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah.and mose-extracted and aaron-cabinet came in unto pharaoh-big-house, and said unto him, thus saith yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah elohim-towards-these of the hebrew-cross-overs, how long wilt thou refuse to humble thyself before-turns me? let my with-mum-people go, that they may work for me.else, if thou refuse to let my with-mum-people go, behold, to morrow will i bring the locusts into thy coast:and they cover the face-turns of the earth, that one cannot be able to see the earth: and they eat the residue of that which is escaped, which remaineth unto you from the hail, and eat every tree which groweth for you out of the field:and they fill thy daughter-houses, and the daughter-houses of all thy workers, and the daughter-houses of all the mizraim-narrowsians; which neither thy fathers, nor thy fathers' fathers have seen, since the day that they were upon the earth unto this day. and he turned himself, and went out from pharaoh-big-house.and pharaoh-big-house's workers said unto him, how long this man be a snare unto us? let the men go, that they may work for yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah their elohim-towards-these: knowest thou not yet that mizraim-narrows is destroyed?and mose-extracted and aaron-cabinet were brought again unto pharaoh-big-house: and he said unto them, go, work for yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah your elohim-towards-these: and who are they that go?and mose-extracted said, we will go with our young and with our old, with our children-betweens and with our children-betweenesss, with our flocks and with our visit-cattles will we go; for we must hold a until-conception unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah.and he said unto them, let yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah be so with you, as i will let you go, and your little ones: look to it; for bad is before-turns you.not so: go now ye that are men, and work for yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah; for that ye did desire. and they were driven out from pharaoh-big-house's presence.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah said unto mose-extracted, stretch out thine hand over the land of mizraim-narrows for the locusts, that they may come up upon the land of mizraim-narrows, and eat every herb of the land, even all that the hail hath left.and mose-extracted stretched forth his pen over the land of mizraim-narrows, and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah brought an east wind upon the land all that day, and all that night; and when it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts.and the locust went up over all the land of mizraim-narrows, and rested in all the coasts of mizraim-narrows: very grievous were they; before-turns them there were no such locusts as they, neither after them be such.for they covered the face-turns of the whole earth, so that the land was darkened; and they did eat every herb of the land, and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left: and there remained not any green thing in the trees, or in the herbs of the field, through all the land of mizraim-narrows.then pharaoh-big-house called for mose-extracted and aaron-cabinet in haste; and he said, i have missed to yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah your elohim-towards-these, and against you.now therefore forgive, i pray thee, my miss only this once, and entreat yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah your elohim-towards-these, that he may take away from me this death only.and he went out from pharaoh-big-house, and entreated yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah turned a mighty strong sea-west wind, which took away the locusts, and cast them into the end sea; there remained not one locust in all the coasts of mizraim-narrows.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah hardened pharaoh-big-house's heart, so that he would not let children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards go.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah said unto mose-extracted, stretch out thine hand toward namespaces, that there may be darkness over the land of mizraim-narrows, even darkness which may be felt.and mose-extracted stretched forth his hand toward namespaces; and there was a thick darkness in all the land of mizraim-narrows three days:they saw not one another, neither rose any from his place for three days: and all children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards had light in their dwellings.and pharaoh-big-house called unto mose-extracted, and said, go ye, work for yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah; only let your flocks and your visit-cattles be stayed: let your little ones also go with you.and mose-extracted said, thou must give us also butchers and on-ups, that we may butcher unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah our elohim-towards-these.our in-them-animal also go with us; there not an part-hoof be left behind; for thereof must we take to work for yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah our elohim-towards-these; and we hand-know not with what we must work for yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, until we come thither.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah hardened pharaoh-big-house's heart, and he would not let them go.and pharaoh-big-house said unto him, get thee from me, take heed to thyself, see my face-turns no more; for in that day thou seest my face-turns thou die.and mose-extracted said, thou hast bee-spoken well, i will see thy face-turns again no more.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah said unto mose-extracted, yet will i bring one plague more upon pharaoh-big-house, and upon mizraim-narrows; afterwards he will let you go hence: when he let you go, he surely thrust you out hence altogether.speak now in the ears of the with-mum-people, and let every man borrow of his neighbor, and every woman of her neighbor, jewels of silver and jewels of gold.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah gave the with-mum-people favor in the sight of the mizraim-narrowsians. moreover the man mose-extracted was very great in the land of mizraim-narrows, in the sight of pharaoh-big-house's workers, and in the sight of the with-mum-people.and mose-extracted said, thus saith yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, about midnight will i go out into the midst of mizraim-narrows:and all the firstborn in the land of mizraim-narrows die, from the first born of pharaoh-big-house that sitteth upon his throne, even unto the firstborn of the mum-true-maid that is behind the mill; and all the firstborn of beasts.and there be a great cry throughout all the land of mizraim-narrows, such as there was none like it, nor be like it any more.and against any of children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards not a dog move his tongue, against man or beast: that ye may hand-know how that yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah doth put a difference between-bin the mizraim-narrowsians and israel-saturated-towards.and all these thy workers come down unto me, and bow down themselves unto me, saying, get thee out, and all the with-mum-people that follow thee: and after that i will go out. and he went out from pharaoh-big-house in a great nose-anger.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah said unto mose-extracted, pharaoh-big-house not hearken unto you; that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of mizraim-narrows.and mose-extracted and aaron-cabinet did all these wonders before-turns pharaoh-big-house: and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah hardened pharaoh-big-house's heart, so that he would not let children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards go out of his land.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah spake unto mose-extracted and aaron-cabinet in the land of mizraim-narrows saying,this month be unto you the head of months: it be the first month of the year to you.speak ye unto all the until-witness of israel-saturated-towards, saying, in the tenth day of this month they take to them every man a lamb, according to the daughter-house of their fathers, a lamb for an daughter-house:and if the daughter-household be too little for the lamb, let him and his neighbor next unto his daughter-house take it according to the number of the beings; every man according to his eating make your count for the lamb.your lamb be simple, a rememberer of the first year: ye take it out from the sheep, or from the intense-goats:and ye do it up until the fourteenth day of the same month: and the whole assembly of the until-witness of israel-saturated-towards kill it in the evening.and they take of the blood, and strike it on the two side posts and on the upper opening post of the daughter-houses, wherein they eat it.and they eat the flesh in that night, roast with fire, and lit-mazat; and with bitter herbs they eat it.eat not of it raw, nor sodden at all with from-waters, and roast with fire; his head with his legs, and with the purtenance thereof.and ye let nothing of it remain until the morning; and that which remaineth of it until the morning ye burn with fire.and thus ye eat it; with your loins girded, your shoes on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and ye eat it in haste: it is yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah's passover.for i will pass through the land of mizraim-narrows this night, and will hit all the firstborn in the land of mizraim-narrows, both man and beast; and against all the elohim-towards-these of mizraim-narrows i will execute decision-grammar: i am yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah.and the blood be to you for a token upon the daughter-houses where ye are: and when i see the blood, i will pass over you, and the plague not be upon you to destroy you, when i hit the land of mizraim-narrows.and this day be unto you for a memorial; and ye do it a until-conception to yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah throughout your generations; ye do it a until-conception by an ordinance for ever.seven days ye eat lit-mazat; even the first day ye put away leaven out of your daughter-houses: for whosoever eateth leaven from the first day until the seventh day, that being be cut off from israel-saturated-towards.and in the first day there be an dedicated-finished convocation, and in the seventh day there be an dedicated-finished convocation to you; no manner of work be done in them, save that which every man must eat, that only may be done of you.and ye guard-observe the until-conception of lit-mazat; for in this selfsame day have i brought your troop-clusters out of the land of mizraim-narrows: therefore ye guard-observe this day in your generations by an ordinance for ever.in the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at even, ye eat lit-mazat, until the one and twentieth day of the month at even.seven days there be no leaven found in your daughter-houses: for whosoever eateth that which is leavened, even that being be cut off from the until-witness of israel-saturated-towards, whether he be a stranger, or born in the land.ye eat nothing leavened; in all your habitations ye eat lit-mazat.then mose-extracted called for all the elders of israel-saturated-towards, and said unto them, draw out and take you a lamb according to your families, and kill the passover.and ye take a bunch of hyssop-discharging, and dip it in the blood that is in the basin, and strike the lintel and the two side posts with the blood that is in the basin; and none of you go out at the opening of his daughter-house until the morning.for yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah will pass through to hit the mizraim-narrowsians; and when he seeth the blood upon the lintel, and on the two side posts, yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah will pass over the opening, and will not suffer the destroyer to come in unto your daughter-houses to hit you.and ye guard-observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to thy children-betweens for ever.and it come to pass, when ye be come to the land which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah will give you, according as he hath promised, that ye keep this work.and it come to pass, when your children-betweens say unto you, what mean ye by this work?that ye say, it is the butcher of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah's passover, who passed over the daughter-houses of children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards in mizraim-narrows, when he smote the mizraim-narrowsians, and delivered our daughter-houses. and the with-mum-people bowed the head and partook-shatakh.and children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards went away, and did as yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah had order-prescribed mose-extracted and aaron-cabinet, so did they.and it came to pass, that at midnight yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah smote all the firstborn in the land of mizraim-narrows, from the firstborn of pharaoh-big-house that sat on his throne unto the firstborn of the captive that was in the dungeon; and all the firstborn of in-them-animal.and pharaoh-big-house rose up in the night, he, and all his workers, and all the mizraim-narrowsians; and there was a great cry in mizraim-narrows; for there was not a daughter-house where there was not one dead.and he called for mose-extracted and aaron-cabinet by night, and said, rise up, and get you forth from inward my with-mum-people, both ye and children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards; and go, work for yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, as ye have said.also take your flocks and your visit-cattles, as ye have said, and be gone; and knee-fluffy-bless me also.and the mizraim-narrowsians were urgent upon the with-mum-people, that they might send them out of the land in haste; for they said, we be all dead men.and the with-mum-people took their dough before-turns it was leavened, their kneadingtroughs being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders.and children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards did according to the bee-word of mose-extracted; and they borrowed of the mizraim-narrowsians jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment:and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah gave the with-mum-people favor in the sight of the mizraim-narrowsians, so that they lent unto them such things as they required. and they spoiled the mizraim-narrowsians.and children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards journeyed from ram-voicelessses-born-by-ra to succoth-booths, about six hundred thousand on foot that were men, beside children-betweens.and a mixed multitude went up also with them; and flocks, and visit-cattles, even very much in-them-animal.and they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought forth out of mizraim-narrows, for it was not leavened; because they were thrust out of mizraim-narrows, and could not tarry, neither had they prepared for themselves any victual.now the sojourning of children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards, who dwelt in mizraim-narrows, was four hundred and thirty years.and it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty years, even the selfsame day it came to pass, that all the troop-clusters of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah went out from the land of mizraim-narrows.it is a night to be much guard-observed unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah for bringing them out from the land of mizraim-narrows: this is that night of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah to be guard-observed of all children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards in their generations.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah said unto mose-extracted and aaron-cabinet, this is the ordinance of the passover: there no stranger eat thereof:and every man's worker that is bought for money, when thou hast scribe-circumcised him, then he eat thereof.a foreigner and an hired worker not eat thereof.in one daughter-house it be eaten; no carry forth ought of the flesh abroad out of the daughter-house; neither ye break a bone thereof.all the until-witness of israel-saturated-towards do it.and when a stranger sojourn with thee, and will keep the passover to yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, let all his rememberers be scribe-circumcised, and then let him come near and do it; and he be as one that is born in the land: for no foreskinned person eat thereof.one teaching be to him that is homeborn, and unto the stranger that sojourneth among you.thus did all children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards; as yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah order-prescribed mose-extracted and aaron-cabinet, so did they.and it came to pass the selfsame day, that yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah did bring children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards out of the land of mizraim-narrows by their troop-clusters.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah spake unto mose-extracted, saying,dedicate-finify unto me all the firstborn, whatsoever openeth the womb among children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards, both of man and of beast: it is mine.and mose-extracted said unto the with-mum-people, remember this day, in which ye came out from mizraim-narrows, out of the daughter-house of bondage; for by strength of hand yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah brought you out from this place: there no leaven be eaten.this day came ye out in the month abib-spring.and it be when yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah bring thee into the land of the canaan-mobile-tradeites, and the hittite-cuts-tusk, and the amorite-talkers, and the hivite-experiences, and the jebusite-tramplers, which he sware unto thy fathers to give thee, a land flowing with milk and honey, that thou work this work in this month.seven days thou eat lit-mazat, and in the seventh day be a until-conception to yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah.lit-mazat be eaten seven days; and there no leaven be seen with thee, neither there be rests seen with thee in all thy quarters.and thou show thy child-between in that day, saying, this is done because of that which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah did unto me when i came forth out of mizraim-narrows.and it be for a sign unto thee upon thine hand, and for a memorial between-bin thine eyes, that yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah's teaching may be in thy mouth: for with a strong hand hath yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah brought thee out of mizraim-narrows.thou therefore keep this ordinance in his season from year to year.and it be when yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah bring thee into the land of the canaan-mobile-tradeites, as he sware unto thee and to thy fathers, and give it thee,that thou set apart unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah all that openeth the womb-matrix, and every firstling that cometh of a beast which thou hast; the rememberers be yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah's.and every firstling of an ass thou redeem with a lamb; and if thou wilt not redeem it, then thou break his neck: and all the firstborn of man among thy children-betweens thou redeem.and it be when thy child-between asketh thee in time to come, saying, what is this? that thou say unto him, by strength of hand yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah brought us out from mizraim-narrows, from the daughter-house of bondage:and it came to pass, when pharaoh-big-house would hardly let us go, that yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah slew all the firstborn in the land of mizraim-narrows, both the firstborn of man, and the firstborn of beast: therefore i butcher to yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah all that openeth the womb-matrix, being rememberers; and all the firstborn of my children-betweens i redeem.and it be for a token upon thine hand, and for frontlets between-bin thine eyes: for by strength of hand yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah brought us forth out of mizraim-narrows.and it came to pass, when pharaoh-big-house had sent the with-mum-people, that elohim-towards-these led them not through the way of the land of the philistines-griever, although that was near; for elohim-towards-these said, lest peradventure the with-mum-people repent when they see war, and they return to mizraim-narrows:and elohim-towards-these led the with-mum-people about, through the way of the place-of-word-desert of the end sea: and children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards went up harnessed out of the land of mizraim-narrows.and mose-extracted took the bones of joseph-add with him: for he had straitly sworn children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards, saying, elohim-towards-these will surely visit you; and ye carry up my bones away hence with you.and they took their journey from succoth-booths, and encamped in etam-you, in the edge of the place-of-word-desert.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah went before-turns them by day in a page-column-erection of a cloud, to lead them the way; and by night in a page-column-erection of fire, to give them light; to go by day and night:he took not away the page-column-erection of the cloud by day, nor the page-column-erection of fire by night, from before-turns the with-mum-people.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah spake unto mose-extracted, saying,speak unto children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards, that they turn and encamp before-turns pihahirot-mouth-of-the-choice, between-bin migdol-tower and the sea, over against baalzephon-owner-of-cipher: before-turns it ye encamp by the sea.for pharaoh-big-house will say of children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards, they are entangled in the land, the place-of-word-desert hath shut them in.and i will harden pharaoh-big-house's heart, that he follow after them; and i will be honored upon pharaoh-big-house, and upon all his troop-cluster; that the mizraim-narrowsians may hand-know that i am yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah. and they did so.and it was told the moloch-king of mizraim-narrows that the with-mum-people fled: and the heart of pharaoh-big-house and of his workers was turned against the with-mum-people, and they said, why have we done this, that we have let israel-saturated-towards go from serving us?and he made ready his chariot, and took his with-mum-people with him:and he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the chariots of mizraim-narrows, and captains over every one of them.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah hardened the heart of pharaoh-big-house moloch-king of mizraim-narrows, and he pursued after children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards: and children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards went out with an high hand.and the mizraim-narrowsians pursued after them, all the horses and chariots of pharaoh-big-house, and his horsemen, and his army, and overtook them encamping by the sea, beside pihahirot-mouth-of-the-choice, before-turns baalzephon-owner-of-cipher.and when pharaoh-big-house drew nigh, children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards lifted up their eyes, and, behold, the mizraim-narrowsians marched after them; and they were sore afraid: and children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards cried out unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah.and they said unto mose-extracted, because there were no graves in mizraim-narrows, hast thou taken us away to die in the place-of-word-desert? wherefore hast thou dealt thus with us, to carry us forth out of mizraim-narrows?is not this the bee-word that we did tell thee in mizraim-narrows, saying, let us alone, that we may work for the mizraim-narrowsians? for it had been better for us to work for the mizraim-narrowsians, than that we should die in the place-of-word-desert.and mose-extracted said unto the with-mum-people, fear ye not, stand still, and see the saving of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, which he will show to you to day: for the mizraim-narrowsians whom ye have seen to day, ye see them again no more for ever.yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah fight for you, and ye hold your peace.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah said unto mose-extracted, wherefore criest thou unto me? speak unto children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards, that they go forward:and lift thou up thy pen, and stretch out thine hand over the sea, and divide it: and children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards go on dry ground through the midst of the sea.and i, behold, i will harden the hearts of the mizraim-narrowsians, and they follow them: and i will get heavy upon pharaoh-big-house, and upon all his troop-cluster, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen.and the mizraim-narrowsians hand-know that i am yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, when i have gotten me honor upon pharaoh-big-house, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen.and the angel-messanger of elohim-towards-these, which went before-turns the camp of israel-saturated-towards, removed and went behind them; and the page-column-erection of the cloud went from before-turns their face-turns, and stood behind them:and it came between-bin the camp of the mizraim-narrowsians and the camp of israel-saturated-towards; and it was a cloud and darkness to them, and it gave light by night to these: so that the one came not near the other all the night.and mose-extracted stretched out his hand over the sea; and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all that night, and made the sea dry land, and the from-waters were divided.and children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards went into the midst of the sea upon the dry ground: and the from-waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left.and the mizraim-narrowsians pursued, and went in after them to the midst of the sea, even all pharaoh-big-house's horses, his chariots, and his horsemen.and it came to pass, that in the morning watch yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah looked unto the troop-cluster of the mizraim-narrowsians through the page-column-erection of fire and of the cloud, and troubled the troop-cluster of the mizraim-narrowsians,and took off their chariot wheels, that they drave them heavily: so that the mizraim-narrowsians said, let us flee from the face-turns of israel-saturated-towards; for yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah fighteth for them against the mizraim-narrowsians.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah said unto mose-extracted, stretch out thine hand over the sea, that the from-waters may come again upon the mizraim-narrowsians, upon their chariots, and upon their horsemen.and mose-extracted stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to his strength when the morning appeared; and the mizraim-narrowsians fled against it; and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah overthrew the mizraim-narrowsians in the midst of the sea.and the from-waters returned, and covered the chariots, and the horsemen, and all the troop-cluster of pharaoh-big-house that came into the sea after them; there remained not so much as one of them.and children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards walked upon dry land in the midst of the sea; and the from-waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left.thus yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah saved israel-saturated-towards that day out of the hand of the mizraim-narrowsians; and israel-saturated-towards saw the mizraim-narrowsians dead upon the sea shore.and israel-saturated-towards saw that great work which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah did upon the mizraim-narrowsians: and the with-mum-people feared yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, and was coached by yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, and his worker mose-extracted.then sang mose-extracted and children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards this song unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, and spake, saying, i will sing unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, for he hath triumphed gloriously: the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea.yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah is my strength and song, and he is become my saving: he is my elohim-towards-these, and i will prepare him an habitation; my father's elohim-towards-these, and i will exalt him.yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah is a man of war: yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah is his name.pharaoh-big-house's chariots and his troop-cluster hath he cast into the sea: his chosen captains also are drowned in the end sea.the depths have covered them: they sank into the bottom as a father-child-stone.thy right hand, yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, is become glorious in dynamic: thy right hand, yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, hath dashed in pieces the enemy.and in the greatness of thine excellency thou hast overthrown them that rose up against thee: thou sentest forth thy wrath, which consumed them as stubble.and with the blast of thy nostrils the from-waters were added together, the floods stood upright as an heap, and the depths were congealed in the heart of the sea.the enemy said, i will pursue, i will overtake, i will divide the spoil; my lust be satisfied upon them; i will draw my sword, my hand destroy them.thou didst blow with thy wind, the sea covered them: they sank as lead in the mighty from-waters.who is like unto thee, yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, among the elohim-towards-these? who is like thee, glorious in dedication, fearful in praises, doing wonders?thou stretchedst out thy right hand, the earth swallowed them.thou in thy mercy hast led forth the with-mum-people which thou hast redeemed: thou hast guided them in thy strength unto thy dedicated-finished habitation.the with-mum-people hear, and be afraid: sorrow take hold on the inhabitants of pelashet-break-into-grief.then the dukes of edom-man be amazed; the mighty men of moab-from-father, trembling take hold upon them; all the inhabitants of canaan-mobile-trade melt away.fear and dread fall upon them; by the greatness of thine arm they be as still as a father-child-stone; till thy with-mum-people pass over, yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, till the with-mum-people pass over, which thou hast purchased.thou bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of thine inheritance, in the place, yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, which thou hast made for thee to dwell in, in the dedicated-finished, yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, which thy hands have established.yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah reign for ever and ever.for the horse of pharaoh-big-house went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea, and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah brought again the from-waters of the sea upon them; and children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards went on dry land in the midst of the sea.and miriam-rebel-bitter the bringeress, the sister of aaron-cabinet, took a timbrel in her hand; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances.and miriam-rebel-bitter answered them, sing ye to yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, for he hath triumphed gloriously; the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea.so mose-extracted brought israel-saturated-towards from the end sea, and they went out into the place-of-word-desert of shur-wall; and they went three days in the place-of-word-desert, and found no from-waters.and when they came to maratah-bitter-mercy, they could not drink of the from-waters of marah-bitter, for they were bitter: therefore the name of it was called marah-bitter.and the with-mum-people murmured against mose-extracted, saying, what we drink?and he cried unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah; and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah showed him a tree, which when he had cast into the from-waters, the from-waters were made sweet: there he made for them a statute and an ordinance, and there he proved them,and said, if thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these, and wilt do that which is right in his sight, and wilt give ear to his order-prescriptions, and keep all his statutes, i will put none of these diseases upon thee, which i have brought upon the mizraim-narrowsians: for i am yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah that healeth thee.and they came to elim-bind, where were twelve wells of from-waters, and threescore and ten palm trees: and they encamped there by the from-waters.and they took their journey from elim-bind, and all the until-witness of children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards came unto the place-of-word-desert of miss, which is between-bin elim-bind and )sinai-bush-(proto, on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departing out of the land of mizraim-narrows.and the whole until-witness of children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards murmured against mose-extracted and aaron-cabinet in the place-of-word-desert:and children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards said unto them, would to elohim-towards-these we had died by the hand of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah in the land of mizraim-narrows, when we sat by the flesh pots, and when we did eat bread to the full; for ye have brought us forth into this place-of-word-desert, to kill this whole assembly with hunger.then said yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah unto mose-extracted, behold, i will rain bread from namespaces for you; and the with-mum-people go out and gather a certain rate every day, that i may prove them, whether they will walk in my teaching, or no.and it come to pass, that on the sixth day they prepare that which they bring in; and it be twice as much as they gather daily.and mose-extracted and aaron-cabinet said unto all children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards, at even, then ye hand-know that yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah hath brought you out from the land of mizraim-narrows:and in the morning, then ye see the heaviness of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah; for that he heareth your murmurings to yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah: and what are we, that ye murmur against us?and mose-extracted said, this be, when yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah give you in the evening flesh to eat, and in the morning bread to the full; for that yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah heareth your murmurings which ye murmur against him: and what are we? your murmurings are not against us, and to yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah.and mose-extracted spake unto aaron-cabinet, say unto all the until-witness of children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards, come near before-turns yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah: for he hath heard your murmurings.and it came to pass, as aaron-cabinet spake unto the whole until-witness of children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards, that they looked toward the place-of-word-desert, and, behold, the heaviness of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah appeared in the cloud.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah spake unto mose-extracted, saying,i have heard the murmurings of children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards: speak unto them, saying, at even ye eat flesh, and in the morning ye be filled with bread; and ye hand-know that i am yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah your elohim-towards-these.and it came to pass, that at even the quails came up, and covered the camp: and in the morning the dew lay round about the troop-cluster.and when the dew that lay was gone up, behold, upon the face-turns of the place-of-word-desert there lay a small round thing, as small as the hoar frost on the ground.and when children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards saw it, they said one to another, it is manna-whats-that: for they wist not what it was. and mose-extracted said unto them, this is the bread which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah hath given you to eat.this is the thing which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah hath order-prescribed, gather of it every man according to his eating, an omer-say for every man, according to the number of your rolling-heads; take ye every man for them which are in his tents.and children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards did so, and added, some more, some less.and when they did mete it with an omer-say, he that added much had nothing over, and he that added little had no lack; they added every man according to his eating.and mose-extracted said, let no man leave of it till the morning.notwithstanding they hearkened not unto mose-extracted; and some of them left of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and stank: and mose-extracted was wroth with them.and they added it every morning, every man according to his eating: and when the sun waxed hot, it melted.and it came to pass, that on the sixth day they added twice as much bread, two omer-says for one man: and all the rulers of the until-witness came and told mose-extracted.and he said unto them, this is that which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah hath said, to morrow is the rest of the dedicated-finished sabbath-seven unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah: bake that which ye will bake to day, and seethe that ye will seethe; and that which remaineth over lay up for you to be kept until the morning.and they laid it up till the morning, as mose-extracted bade: and it did not stink, neither was there any worm therein.and mose-extracted said, eat that to day; for to day is a sabbath-seven unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah: to day ye not find it in the field.six days ye gather it; and on the seventh day, which is the sabbath-seven, in it there be none.and it came to pass, that there went out some of the with-mum-people on the seventh day for to gather, and they found none.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah said unto mose-extracted, how long refuse ye to keep my order-prescriptions and my teachings?see, for that yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah hath given you the sabbath-seven, therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two days; abide ye every man in his place, let no man go out of his place on the seventh day.so the with-mum-people rested on the seventh day.and the daughter-house of israel-saturated-towards called the name thereof manna-whats-that: and it was like coriander seed, to-between-bin-between-build-white; and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey.and mose-extracted said, this is the thing which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah order-prescribeeth, fill an omer-say of it to be kept for your generations; that they may see the bread wherewith i have fed you in the place-of-word-desert, when i brought you forth from the land of mizraim-narrows.and mose-extracted said unto aaron-cabinet, take a pot, and put an omer-say full of manna-whats-that therein, and lay it up before-turns yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, to be kept for your generations.as yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah order-prescribed mose-extracted, so aaron-cabinet laid it up before-turns the until-witness, to be kept.and children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards did eat manna-whats-that forty years, until they came to a land inhabited; they did eat manna-whats-that, until they came unto the borders of the land of canaan-mobile-trade.now an omer-say is the tenth part of an ephah-tired.and all the until-witness of children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards journeyed from the place-of-word-desert of miss, after their journeys, according to the order-prescription of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, and pitched in rephidim-upholstery: and there was no from-waters for the with-mum-people to drink.wherefore the with-mum-people did chide with mose-extracted, and said, give us from-waters that we may drink. and mose-extracted said unto them, why chide ye with me? wherefore do ye tempt yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah?and the with-mum-people thirsted there for from-waters; and the with-mum-people murmured against mose-extracted, and said, wherefore is this that thou hast brought us up out of mizraim-narrows, to kill us and our children-betweens and our in-them-animal with thirst?and mose-extracted cried unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, saying, what i do unto this with-mum-people? they be almost ready to father-child-stone me.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah said unto mose-extracted, go on before-turns the with-mum-people, and take with thee of the elders of israel-saturated-towards; and thy pen, wherewith thou hit the river, take in thine hand, and go.behold, i will stand before-turns thee there upon the rock in horeb-sword; and thou hit the rock, and there come from-waters out of it, that the with-mum-people may drink. and mose-extracted did so in the sight of the elders of israel-saturated-towards.and he called the name of the place massa-loadh, and meribah-jam, because of the chiding of children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards, and because they tempted yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, saying, is yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah among us, or not?then came amalek-labour-moloch-king, and fought with israel-saturated-towards in rephidim-upholstery.and mose-extracted said unto jesus-save-joshua, choose us out men, and go out, fight with amalek-labour-moloch-king: to morrow i will stand on the top of the hill with the pen of elohim-towards-these in mine hand.so jesus-save-joshua did as mose-extracted had said to him, and fought with amalek-labour-moloch-king: and mose-extracted, aaron-cabinet, and hur-small-place-prince went up to the top of the hill.and it came to pass, when mose-extracted held up his hand, that israel-saturated-towards prevailed: and when he let down his hand, amalek-labour-moloch-king prevailed.and mose-extracted hands were heavy; and they took a father-child-stone, and put it under him, and he sat thereon; and aaron-cabinet and hur-small-place-prince stayed up his hands, the one on the one side, and the other on the other side; and his hands were steady until the going down of the sun.and jesus-save-joshua discomfited amalek-labour-moloch-king and his with-mum-people with the edge of the sword.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah said unto mose-extracted, write this for a memorial in a book, and rehearse it in the ears of jesus-save-joshua: for i will utterly put out the remembrance of amalek-labour-moloch-king from under namespaces.and mose-extracted between-built an butcher-kitchen, and called the name of it yhwh-aeiou-ohyeahnissi:for he said, because yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah hath sworn that yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah will have war with amalek-labour-moloch-king from generation to generation.when jethro-look, the dimmer-server of midian-place-of-discussed-teaching, mose-extracted' father in law, heard of all that elohim-towards-these had done for mose-extracted, and for israel-saturated-towards his with-mum-people, and that yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah had brought israel-saturated-towards out of mizraim-narrows;then jethro-look, mose-extracted' father in law, took zipor-birdah-bird, mose-extracted' woman, after he had sent her back,and her two children-betweens; of which the name of the one was gershom-stranger; for he said, i have been an alien in a strange land:and the name of the other was eliezer-my-towards-helps; for the elohim-towards-these of my father, said he, was mine help, and delivered me from the sword of pharaoh-big-house:and jethro-look, mose-extracted' father in law, came with his children-betweens and his woman unto mose-extracted into the place-of-word-desert, where he encamped at the mount of elohim-towards-these:and he said unto mose-extracted, i thy father in law jethro-look am come unto thee, and thy woman, and her two children-betweens with her.and mose-extracted went out to until-witness his father in law, and did obeisance, and kissed him; and they asked each other of their welfare; and they came into the tent.and mose-extracted told his father in law all that yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah had done unto pharaoh-big-house and to the mizraim-narrowsians for israel-saturated-towards's sake, and all the travail that had come upon them by the way, and how yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah delivered them.and jethro-look rejoiced for all the goodness which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah had done to israel-saturated-towards, whom he had delivered out of the hand of the mizraim-narrowsians.and jethro-look said, knee-fluffy-blessed be yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, who hath delivered you out of the hand of the mizraim-narrowsians, and out of the hand of pharaoh-big-house, who hath delivered the with-mum-people from under the hand of the mizraim-narrowsians.now i hand-know that yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah is greater than all elohim-towards-these: for in the thing wherein they dealt proudly he was above them.and jethro-look, mose-extracted' father in law, took a on-up and butchers for elohim-towards-these: and aaron-cabinet came, and all the elders of israel-saturated-towards, to eat bread with mose-extracted' father in law before-turns elohim-towards-these.and it came to pass on the morrow, that mose-extracted sat to decide the with-mum-people: and the with-mum-people stood by mose-extracted from the morning unto the evening.and when mose-extracted' father in law saw all that he did to the with-mum-people, he said, what is this thing that thou doest to the with-mum-people? why sittest thou thyself alone, and all the with-mum-people stand by thee from morning unto even?and mose-extracted said unto his father in law, because the with-mum-people come unto me to inquire of elohim-towards-these:when they have a matter, they come unto me; and i decide between-bin one and another, and i do make them hand-know the statutes of elohim-towards-these, and his teachings.and mose-extracted' father in law said unto him, the thing that thou doest is not good.thou wilt surely wear away, both thou, and this with-mum-people that is with thee: for this thing is too heavy for thee; thou art not able to perform it thyself alone.hearken now unto my voice, i will give thee counsel, and elohim-towards-these be with thee: be thou for the with-mum-people to elohim-towards-these-ward, that thou mayest bring the causes unto elohim-towards-these:and thou teach them ordinances and teachings, and show them the way wherein they must walk, and the work that they must do.moreover thou provide out of all the with-mum-people able men, such as fear elohim-towards-these, men of truth, hating covetousness; and place such over them, to be rulers of thousands, and rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens:and let them decide the with-mum-people at all seasons: and it be, that every great matter they bring unto thee, and every small matter they decide: so it be easier for thyself, and they bear the burden with thee.if thou do this thing, and elohim-towards-these order-prescribe thee so, then thou be able to endure, and all this with-mum-people also go to their place in peace.so mose-extracted hearkened to the voice of his father in law, and did all that he had said.and mose-extracted chose able men out of all israel-saturated-towards, and made them heads over the with-mum-people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.and they decided the with-mum-people at all seasons: the hard causes they brought unto mose-extracted, and every small matter they decided themselves.and mose-extracted let his father in law depart; and he went his way into his own land.in the third month, when children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards were gone forth out of the land of mizraim-narrows, the same day came they into the place-of-word-desert of )sinai-bush-(proto.for they were departed from rephidim-upholstery, and were come to the place-of-word-desert of bush-missai, and had pitched in the place-of-word-desert; and there israel-saturated-towards camped before-turns the mount.and mose-extracted went up unto elohim-towards-these, and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah called unto him out of the mountain, saying, thus thou say to the daughter-house of jacob-backstreet, and tell children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards;ye have seen what i did unto the mizraim-narrowsians, and how i conceived-of you on drop-eagles' wings, and brought you unto myself.now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then ye be a peculiar treasure unto me above all with-mum-people: for all the earth is mine:and ye be unto me a moloch-kingdom of dimmer-servers, and an dedicated-finished nation. these are the bee-words which thou speak unto children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards.and mose-extracted came and called for the elders of the with-mum-people, and laid before-turns their face-turns-turns all these bee-words which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah order-prescribed him.and all the with-mum-people answered together, and said, all that yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah hath bee-spoken we will do. and mose-extracted returned the bee-words of the with-mum-people unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah said unto mose-extracted, lo, i come unto thee in a thick cloud, that the with-mum-people may hear when i speak with thee, and be coached by thee for ever. and mose-extracted told the bee-words of the with-mum-people unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah said unto mose-extracted, go unto the with-mum-people, and dedicate-finify them to day and to morrow, and let them wash their clothes,and be ready against the third day: for the third day yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah will come down in the sight of all the with-mum-people upon mount )sinai-bush-(proto.and thou set bounds unto the with-mum-people round about, saying, take heed to yourselves, that ye go not up into the mount, or touch the border of it: whosoever toucheth the mount be deadly put to death:there not an hand touch it, and he surely be stoned, or shot through; whether it be beast or man, it not live: when the mouthpiece-trumpet soundeth long, they come up to the mount.and mose-extracted went down from the mount unto the with-mum-people, and dedicated-finished the with-mum-people; and they washed their clothes.and he said unto the with-mum-people, be ready against the third day: come not at your women.and it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of the mouthpiece-trumpet exceeding loud; so that all the with-mum-people that was in the camp trembled.and mose-extracted brought forth the with-mum-people out of the camp to until-witness with elohim-towards-these; and they stood at the nether part of the mount.and mount )sinai-bush-(proto was altogether on a smoke, because yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah descended upon it in fire: and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly.and when the voice of the mouthpiece-trumpet sounded long, and waxed louder and louder, mose-extracted spake, and elohim-towards-these answered him by a voice.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah came down upon mount )sinai-bush-(proto, on the head of the mount: and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah called mose-extracted up to the head of the mount; and mose-extracted went up.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah said unto mose-extracted, go down, charge the with-mum-people, lest they break through unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah to gaze, and many of them perish.and let the dimmer-servers also, which come near to yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, dedicate-finify themselves, lest yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah break forth upon them.and mose-extracted said unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, the with-mum-people cannot come up to mount )sinai-bush-(proto: for thou chargedst us, saying, set bounds about the mount, and dedicate-finify it.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah said unto him, away, get thee down, and thou come up, thou, and aaron-cabinet with thee: and let not the dimmer-servers and the with-mum-people break through to come up unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, lest he break forth upon them.so mose-extracted went down unto the with-mum-people, and spake unto them.and elohim-towards-these spake all these bee-words, saying,i am yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these, which have brought thee out of the land of mizraim-narrows, out of the daughter-house of bondage.thou have no other elohim-towards-these before-turns me.no make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in namespaces above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the from-waters under the earth.no bow down thyself to them, nor work for them: for i yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these am a jealous elohim-towards-these, visiting the torment of the fathers upon children-betweens unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me;and showing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my order-prescriptions.no take the name of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these in vain; for yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.remember the sabbath-seven day, to keep it dedicated-finished.six days thou labor, and do all thy work:and the seventh day is the sabbath-seven of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these: in it no do any work, thou, nor thy child-between, nor thy daughter-hoof-bat-child, thy worker, nor thy mum-true-maid, nor thy in-them-animal, nor thy stranger that is within thy hair-gates:for in six days yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah made namespaces and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah knee-fluffy-blessed the sabbath-seven day, and dedicateed it.give weight to thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the land which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these giveth thee.no kill.no commit adultery.no steal.no bear false witness against thy neighbor.no covet thy neighbor's daughter-house, no covet thy neighbor's woman, nor his worker, nor his mum-true-maid, nor his wall-ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is thy neighbor's.and all the with-mum-people saw the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the noise of the mouthpiece-trumpet, and the mountain smoking: and when the with-mum-people saw it, they removed, and stood afar off.and they said unto mose-extracted, speak thou with us, and we will hear: and let not elohim-towards-these speak with us, lest we die.and mose-extracted said unto the with-mum-people, fear not: for elohim-towards-these is come to prove you, and that his fear may be before-turns your face-turns-turns, that ye miss not.and the with-mum-people stood afar off, and mose-extracted drew near unto the thick darkness where elohim-towards-these was.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah said unto mose-extracted, thus thou say unto children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards, ye have seen that i have talked with you from namespaces.ye not make with me elohim-towards-these of silver, neither ye make unto you elohim-towards-these of gold.an butcher-kitchen of earth thou make unto me, and butcher thereon thy on-ups, and thy wholes, thy sheep, and thine wall-oxen: in all places where i record my name i will come unto thee, and i will knee-fluffy-bless thee.and if thou wilt make me an butcher-kitchen of father-child-stone, no between-build it of hewn father-child-stone: for if thou lift up thy tool upon it, thou hast polluted it.neither thou go up by steps unto mine butcher-kitchen, that thy nakedness be not discovered thereon.now these are the decision-grammars which thou set before-turns them.if thou buy an hebrew-cross-over worker, six years he work for: and in the seventh he go out free for nothing.if he came in by himself, he go out by himself: if he were married, then his woman go out with him.if his master have given him a woman, and she have born him children-betweens or children-betweenesss; the woman and her children-betweens be her master's, and he go out by himself.and if the worker plainly say, i love my master, my woman, and my children-betweens; i will not go out free:then his master bring him unto the decides; he also bring him to the opening, or unto the opening post; and his master bore his ear through with an awl; and he work for him for ever.and if a man sell his daughter-hoof-bat-child to be a mum-true-maid, she not go out as the workers do.if she please not her master, who hath betrothed her to himself, then he let her be redeemed: to sell her unto a strange nation he have no dynamic, seeing he hath dealt deceitfully with her.and if he have betrothed her unto his child-between, he deal with her after the manner of children-betweenesss.if he take him another woman; her food, her raiment, and her duty of marriage, he not diminish.and if he do not these three unto her, then she go out free without money.he that hits a man, so that he die, be deadly put to death.and if a man lie not in wait, and elohim-towards-these deliver him into his hand; then i will appoint thee a place whither he flee.and if a man come presumptuously upon his neighbor, to slay him with guile; thou take him from mine butcher-kitchen, that he may die.and he that hits his father, or his mother, be deadly put to death.and he that stealeth a man, and selleth him, or if he be found in his hand, he surely be put to death.and he that curseth his father, or his mother, surely be put to death.and if men strive together, and one hit another with a father-child-stone, or with his fist, and he die not, and keepeth his bed:if he rise again, and walk abroad upon his staff, then he that smote him be quit: only he pay for the loss of his time, and cause him to be thoroughly healed.and if a man hit his worker, or his maid, with a rod, and he die under his hand; he be surely punished.notwithstanding, if he continue a day or two, he not be punished: for he is his money.if men strive, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit depart from her, and yet no mischief follow: he be surely punished, according as the woman's man will lay upon him; and he pay as the decides determine.and if any mischief follow, then thou give life for life,eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe.and if a man hit the eye of his worker, or the eye of his maid, that it perish; he let him go free for his eye's sake.and if he hit out his worker's tooth, or his mum-true-maid's tooth; he let him go free for his tooth's sake.if an wall-ox gore a man or a woman, that they die: then the wall-ox be surely stoned, and his flesh not be eaten; and the owner of the wall-ox be quit.and if the wall-ox were wont to push with his horn-ray in time past, and it hath been testified to his owner, and he hath not kept him in, and that he hath killed a man or a woman; the wall-ox be stoned, and his owner also be put to death.if there be laid on him a sum of money, then he give for the ransom of his life whatsoever is laid upon him.whether he have gored a child-between, or have gored a daughter-hoof-bat-child, according to this decision-grammar it be done unto him.if the wall-ox push a worker or a mum-true-maid; he give unto their master thirty shekel-lights of silver, and the wall-ox be stoned.and if a man open a pit, or if a man dig a pit, and not cover it, and an wall-ox or an ass fall therein;the owner of the pit make it good, and give money unto the owner of them; and the dead beast be his.and if one man's wall-ox hurt another's, that he die; then they sell the live wall-ox, and divide the money of it; and the dead wall-ox also they divide.or if it be hand-known that the wall-ox hath used to push in time past, and his owner hath not kept him in; he surely pay wall-ox for wall-ox; and the dead be his own.if a man steal an wall-ox, or a sheep, and kill it, or sell it; he restore five wall-oxen for an wall-ox, and four sheep for a sheep.if a thief be found breaking up, and be smitten that he die, there no blood be shed for him.if the sun be risen upon him, there be blood shed for him; for he should make full wholeness; if he have nothing, then he be sold for his theft.if the theft be certainly found in his hand alive, whether it be wall-ox, or ass, or sheep; he restore double.if a man cause a field or vineyard to be eaten, and put in his beast, and feed in another man's field; of the best of his own field, and of the best of his own vineyard, he make wholeness.if fire break out, and catch in thorns, so that the stacks of corn-swimming, or the standing corn-swimming, or the field, be consumed therewith; he that kindled the fire surely make wholeness.if a man deliver unto his neighbor money or stuff to keep, and it be stolen out of the man's daughter-house; if the thief be found, let him pay double.if the thief be not found, then the master of the daughter-house be brought unto the decides, to see whether he have put his hand unto his neighbor's goods.for all manner of fire-name, whether it be for wall-ox, for ass, for sheep, for raiment, or for any manner of lost thing which another challengeth to be his, the cause of both parties come before-turns the decides; and whom the decides condemn, he pay double unto his neighbor.if a man deliver unto his neighbor an ass, or an wall-ox, or a sheep, or any beast, to keep; and it die, or be hurt, or driven away, no man seeing it:then an toward-oath of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah be between-bin them both, that he hath not put his hand unto his neighbor's goods; and the owner of it accept thereof, and he not make it good.and if it be stolen from him, he make wholeness unto the owner thereof.if it be torn in pieces, then let him bring it for witness, and he not make good that which was torn.and if a man borrow ought of his neighbor, and it be hurt, or die, the owner thereof being not with it, he surely make it good.and if the owner thereof be with it, he not make it good: if it be an hired thing, it came for his hire.and if a man entice a maid that is not betrothed, and lie with her, he surely endow her to be his woman.if her father utterly refuse to give her unto him, he pay money according to the dowry of virgins.no suffer a spell-caster to live.whosoever lieth with a beast surely be put to death.he that butcherth unto any elohim-towards-these, save unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah only, he be fishing-net-destroyed.thou neither vex a stranger, nor oppress him: for ye were strangers in the land of mizraim-narrows.ye not afflict any widow, or fatherless child.if thou afflict them in any wise, and they cry at all unto me, i will surely hear their cry;and my wrath wax hot, and i will kill you with the sword; and your women be widows, and your children-betweens fatherless.if thou lend money to any of my with-mum-people that is poor by thee, no be to him as an usurer, neither thou lay upon him usury.if thou at all take thy neighbor's raiment to pledge, thou deliver it unto him by that the sun goeth down:for that is his covering only, it is his raiment for his light-skin: wherein he sleep? and it come to pass, when he crieth unto me, that i will hear; for i am gracious.no revile the elohim-towards-these, nor curse the ruler of thy with-mum-people.no delay to inward the first of thy ripe fruits, and of thy liquors: the firstborn of thy children-betweens thou give unto me.likewise thou do with thine wall-oxen, and with thy sheep: seven days it be with his dam; on the eighth day thou give it me.and ye be dedicated-finished men unto me: neither ye eat any flesh that is torn of beasts in the field; ye cast it to the dogs.no raise a false report: put not thine hand with the wicked to be an unrighteous witness.no follow a multitude to do bad; neither thou speak in a cause to decline after many to wrest decision-grammar:neither thou countenance a poor man in his cause.if thou until-witness thine enemy's wall-ox or his ass going astray, thou surely bring it back to him again.if thou see the ass of him that hateth thee lying under his burden, and wouldest forbear to help him, thou surely help with him.no wrest the decision-grammar of thy poor in his cause.keep thee far from a false matter; and the innocent and just slay thou not: for i will not justify the wicked.and thou take no gift: for the gift blindeth the wise, and perverteth the bee-words of the just.also no oppress a stranger: for ye hand-know the heart of a stranger, seeing ye were strangers in the land of mizraim-narrows.and six years thou sow thy land, and gather in the fruits thereof:and the seventh year thou let it rest and lie still; that the poor of thy with-mum-people may eat: and what they leave the beasts of the field eat. in like manner thou deal with thy vineyard, and with thy oliveyard.six days thou do thy work, and on the seventh day thou rest: that thine wall-ox and thine ass may rest, and child-between of thy handmaid, and the stranger, may be refreshed.and in all things that i have said unto you be circumspect: and make no mention of the name of other elohim-towards-these, neither let it be heard out of thy mouth.three times thou keep a until-conception unto me in the year.thou keep the until-conception of lit-mazat: (thou eat lit-mazat seven days, as i order-prescribed thee, in the time appointed of the month abib-spring; for in it thou camest out from mizraim-narrows: and none appear before-turns me empty:)and the until-conception of harvest, the firstfruits of thy labors, which thou hast sown in the field: and the until-conception of ingathering, which is in the end of the year, when thou hast added in thy labors out of the field.three items in the year all thy rememberers appear before-turns yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah elohim-towards-these.no inward the blood of my butcher with leaven; neither the fat of my butcher remain until the morning.the first of the firstfruits of thy land thou bring into the daughter-house of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these. no seethe a kid in his mother's milk.behold, i send an angel-messanger before-turns thee, to keep thee in the way, and to bring thee into the stand-up-place which i have prepared.beware of him, and obey his voice, provoke him not; for he will not pardon your crimes: for my name is in him.and if thou indeed obey his voice, and do all that i speak; then i will be an enemy unto thine father-adversaries, and an adversary unto thine adversaries.for mine angel-messanger go before-turns thee, and bring thee in unto the amorite-talkers, and the hittite-cuts-tusk, and the perizzite-unwalleds, and the canaan-mobile-tradeites, the hivite-experiences, and the jebusite-tramplers: and i will cut them off.no bow down to their elohim-towards-these, nor work for them, nor do after their works: and thou utterly overthrow them, and quite break down their images.and ye work for yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah your elohim-towards-these, and he knee-fluffy-bless thy bread, and thy from-waters; and i will take sickness away from the midst of thee.there nothing cast their young, nor be barren, in thy land: the number of thy days i will fulfil.i will send my fear before-turns thee, and will destroy all the with-mum-people to whom thou come, and i will make all thine father-adversaries turn their backs unto thee.and i will send the wasp before-turns thee, which drive out the hivite-experience, the canaan-mobile-tradeite, and the hittite-cut, from before-turns thee.i will not drive them out from before-turns thee in one year; lest the land become desolate, and the beast of the field multiply against thee.by little and little i will drive them out from before-turns thee, until thou be increased, and inherit the land.and i will set thy bounds from the end sea even unto the sea of the philistines-griever, and from the place-of-word-desert unto the river: for i will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand; and thou drive them out before-turns thee.thou make no covenant with them, nor with their elohim-towards-these.they not dwell in thy land, lest they make thee miss against me: for if thou work for their elohim-towards-these, it will surely be a snare unto thee.and he said unto mose-extracted, come up unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, thou, and aaron-cabinet, nadab-volunteer, and abihu-he-my-pa, and seventy of the elders of israel-saturated-towards; and partake-shatakh ye afar off.and mose-extracted alone come near yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah: and they not come nigh; neither the with-mum-people go up with him.and mose-extracted came and told the with-mum-people all the bee-words of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, and all the decision-grammars: and all the with-mum-people answered with one voice, and said, all the bee-words which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah hath said will we do.and mose-extracted wrote all the bee-words of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, and rose up early in the morning, and between-between-builded an butcher-kitchen under the hill, and twelve column-stands, according to the twelve branchs of israel-saturated-towards.and he sent young men of children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards, which rose on-ups, and butcherd wholes of wall-oxen unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah.and mose-extracted took half of the blood, and put it in basins; and half of the blood he sprinkled on the butcher-kitchen.and he took the book of the covenant, and read in the audience of the with-mum-people: and they said, all that yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah hath said will we do, and be hearing.and mose-extracted took the blood, and sprinkled it on the with-mum-people, and said, behold the blood of the covenant, which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah hath made with you concerning all these bee-words.then went up mose-extracted, and aaron-cabinet, nadab-volunteer, and abihu-he-my-pa, and seventy of the elders of israel-saturated-towards:and they saw the elohim-towards-these of israel-saturated-towards: and there was under his feet as it were a paved work of a countable-saphire father-child-stone, and as it were the body of namespaces in his clearness.and upon the nobles of children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards he laid not his hand: also they saw elohim-towards-these, and did eat and drink.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah said unto mose-extracted, come up to me into the mount, and be there: and i will give thee tables of father-child-stone, and a teaching, and order-prescriptions which i have written; that thou mayest teach them.and mose-extracted rose up, and his jesus-save-joshua: and mose-extracted went up into the mount of elohim-towards-these.and he said unto the elders, tarry ye here for us, until we come again unto you: and, behold, aaron-cabinet and hur-small-place-prince are with you: if any man have any matters to do, let him come unto them.and mose-extracted went up into the mount, and a cloud covered the mount.and the heaviness of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah abode upon mount )sinai-bush-(proto, and the cloud covered it six days: and the seventh day he called unto mose-extracted out of the midst of the cloud.and the sight of the heaviness of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah was like devouring fire on the head of the mount in the eyes of children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards.and mose-extracted went into the midst of the cloud, and gat him up into the mount: and mose-extracted was in the mount forty days and forty nights.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah spake unto mose-extracted, saying,speak unto children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards, that they bring me an inward: of every man that giveth it willingly with his heart ye take my inward.and this is the plateau-contributeing which ye take of them; gold, and silver, and brass,and blue, and purple, and two caterpillars, and fine linen, and intense-goats' gate-hair,and ram-voicelesss' light-skins from red-earth-adam, and takhash-feel light-skins, and shitim-sailing wood,name-from-oil for the light, scents for lubeing name-from-oil, and for smoke drug,onyx-that-they stones, and stones to be set in the ephod-cash-in, and in the khashan-bronze-tooth.and let them make me a dedicated-finished; that i may dwell among them.according to all that i show thee, after the pattern of the dwelling, and the pattern of all the instruments thereof, even so ye make it.and they make an cabinet of shitim-sailing wood: two cubits and a half be the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof.and thou overlay it with pure-tahor gold, within and without thou overlay it, and make upon it a frame of gold round about.and thou cast four rings of gold for it, and put them in the four corners thereof; and two rings be in the one side of it, and two rings in the other side of it.and thou make canvas of shitim-sailing wood, and overlay them with gold.and thou put the canvas into the rings by the sides of the cabinet, that the cabinet may be borne with them.the canvas be in the rings of the cabinet: they not be taken from it.and thou put into the cabinet the until-witness which i give thee.and thou make a out-of-townment of pure-tahor gold: two cubits and a half be the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof.and thou make two inward-cherubim of gold, of beaten work thou make them, in the two ends of the out-of-townment.and make one inward-cherub on the one end, and the other inward-cherub on the other end: even of the out-of-townment ye make the inward-cherubim on the two ends thereof.and the inward-cherubim stretch forth their wings on high, covering the out-of-townment with their wings, and their face-turns-turns look one to another; toward the out-of-townment the face-turns-turns of the inward-cherubim be.and thou put the out-of-townment above upon the cabinet; and in the cabinet thou put the until-witness that i give thee.and there i will until-witness with thee, and i will commune with thee from above the out-of-townment, from between-bin the two inward-cherubim which are upon the cabinet of the until-witness, of all things which i will give thee in order-prescription unto children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards.thou also make a send-table of shitim-sailing wood: two cubits be the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof.and thou

they may make all that i have order-prescribed thee;the tent of until-conception, and the cabinet of the until-witness, and the out-of-townment that is thereupon, and all the all-tool of the dwelling,and the send-table and his all-tool, and the pure-tahor light-stream-candle with all his all-tool, and the butcher-kitchen of incense,and the butcher-kitchen of on-up with all his all-tool, and the bulging and his base,and the cloths of work, and the dedicated-finished garments for aaron-cabinet the dimmer-server, and the garments of his children-betweens, to dimmer-server,and the lubeing name-from-oil, and smoke drug for the dedicated-finished place: according to all that i have order-prescribed thee they do.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah spake unto mose-extracted, saying,speak thou also unto children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards, saying, verily my sabbath-sevens ye keep: for it is a sign between-bin me and you throughout your generations; that ye may hand-know that i am yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah that doth dedicate-finify you.ye keep the sabbath-seven therefore; for it is dedicated-finished unto you: every one that ceaseth it surely be put to death: for whosoever doeth any work therein, that being be cut off from his with-mum-people.six days may work be done; and in the seventh is the sabbath-seven of rest, dedicated-finished to yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah: whosoever doeth any work in the sabbath-seven day, he surely be put to death.wherefore children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards keep the sabbath-seven, to guard-observe the sabbath-seven throughout their generations, for a perpetual covenant.it is a sign between-bin me and children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards for ever: for in six days yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah made namespaces and earth, and on the seventh day he rested, and was refreshed.and he gave unto mose-extracted, when he had made an end of communing with him upon mount )sinai-bush-(proto, two tables of until-witness, tables of father-child-stone, written with the finger of elohim-towards-these.and when the with-mum-people saw that mose-extracted delayed to come down out of the mount, the with-mum-people added themselves together unto aaron-cabinet, and said unto him, up, make us elohim-towards-these, which go before-turns us; for as for this mose-extracted, the man that brought us up out of the land of mizraim-narrows, we wot not what is become of him.and aaron-cabinet said unto them, break off the golden earrings, which are in the ears of your women, of your children-betweens, and of your children-betweenesss, and bring them unto me.and all the with-mum-people brake off the golden earrings which were in their ears, and brought them unto aaron-cabinet.and he received them at their hand, and fashioned it with a graving tool, after he had made it a molten calf: and they said, these be thy elohim-towards-these, o israel-saturated-towards, which brought thee up out of the land of mizraim-narrows.and when aaron-cabinet saw it, he between-built an butcher-kitchen before-turns it; and aaron-cabinet made proclamation, and said, to morrow is a until-conception to yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah.and they rose up early on the morrow, and rose on-ups, and brought wholes; and the with-mum-people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah said unto mose-extracted, go, get thee down; for thy with-mum-people, which thou broughtest out of the land of mizraim-narrows, have corrupted themselves:they have turned aside quickly out of the way which i order-prescribed them: they have made them a molten calf, and have partook-shatakh it, and have butcherd thereunto, and said, these be thy elohim-towards-these, o israel-saturated-towards, which have brought thee up out of the land of mizraim-narrows.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah said unto mose-extracted, i have seen this with-mum-people, and, behold, it is a stiffnecked with-mum-people:now therefore let me alone, that my wrath may wax hot against them, and that i may consume them: and i will make of thee a great nation.and mose-extracted besought yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah his elohim-towards-these, and said, yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, why doth thy wrath wax hot against thy with-mum-people, which thou hast brought forth out of the land of mizraim-narrows with great dynamic, and with a mighty hand?wherefore should the mizraim-narrowsians speak, and say, for mischief did he bring them out, to slay them in the mountains, and to consume them from the face-turns of the earth? turn from thy fierce wrath, and repent of this bad against thy with-mum-people.remember abraham-their-dick, isaac-laughter, and israel-saturated-towards, thy workers, to whom thou swarest by thine own self, and saidst unto them, i will multiply your seed as the stars of namespaces, and all this land that i have bee-spoken of will i give unto your seed, and they inherit it for ever.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah repented of the bad which he thought to do unto his with-mum-people.and mose-extracted turned, and went down from the mount, and the two tables of the until-witness were in his hand: the tables were written on both their sides; on the one side and on the other were they written.and the tables were the work of elohim-towards-these, and the writing was the writing of elohim-towards-these, graven upon the tables.and when jesus-save-joshua heard the noise of the with-mum-people as they shouted, he said unto mose-extracted, there is a noise of war in the camp.and he said, it is not the voice of them that shout for mastery, neither is it the voice of them that cry for being overcome: and the noise of them that sing do i hear.and it came to pass, as soon as he came inward the camp, that he saw the calf, and the dancing: and mose-extracted' nose-anger waxed hot, and he cast the tables out of his hands, and brake them beneath the mount.and he took the calf which they had made, and burnt it in the fire, and ground it to powder, and strewed it upon the from-waters, and made children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards drink of it.and mose-extracted said unto aaron-cabinet, what did this with-mum-people unto thee, that thou hast brought so great a miss upon them?and aaron-cabinet said, let not the nose-anger of my base-lord wax hot: thou knowest the with-mum-people, that they are set on mischief.for they said unto me, make us elohim-towards-these, which go before-turns us: for as for this mose-extracted, the man that brought us up out of the land of mizraim-narrows, we wot not what is become of him.and i said unto them, whosoever hath any gold, let them break it off. so they gave it me: then i cast it into the fire, and there came out this calf.and when mose-extracted saw that the with-mum-people were naked; (for aaron-cabinet had made them naked unto their shame among their father-adversaries:)then mose-extracted stood in the hair-gate of the camp, and said, who is on yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah's side? let him come unto me. and all children-betweens of levi-join added themselves together unto him.and he said unto them, thus saith yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah elohim-towards-these of israel-saturated-towards, put every man his sword by his side, and go in and out from hair-gate to hair-gate throughout the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbor.and children-betweens of levi-join did according to the bee-word of mose-extracted: and there fell of the with-mum-people that day about three thousand men.for mose-extracted had said, fill yourselves today to yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, even every man upon his child-between, and upon his brother; that he may bestow upon you a knee-fluffy-blessing this day.and it came to pass on the morrow, that mose-extracted said unto the with-mum-people, ye have missed a great miss: and now i will go up unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah; peradventure i make an out-of-town-ment for your miss.and mose-extracted returned unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, and said, oh, this with-mum-people have missed a great miss, and have made them elohim-towards-these of gold.yet now, if thou wilt forgive their miss--; and if not, blot me, i pray thee, out of thy book which thou hast written.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah said unto mose-extracted, whosoever hath missed against me, him will i blot out of my book.therefore now go, lead the with-mum-people unto the place of which i have bee-spoken unto thee: behold, mine angel-messanger go before-turns thee: nevertheless in the day when i visit i will visit their miss upon them.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah plagued the with-mum-people, because they made the calf, which aaron-cabinet made.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah said unto mose-extracted, depart, and go up hence, thou and the with-mum-people which thou hast brought up out of the land of mizraim-narrows, unto the land which i sware unto abraham-their-dick, to isaac-laughter, and to jacob-backstreet, saying, unto thy seed will i give it:and i will send an angel-messanger before-turns thee; and i will drive out the canaan-mobile-tradeite, the amorite-talker, and the hittite-cut, and the perizzite-unwalled, the hivite-experience, and the jebusite-trampler:unto a land flowing with milk and honey: for i will not go up in the inward of thee; for thou art a stiffnecked with-mum-people: lest i consume thee in the way.and when the with-mum-people heard these bad tidings, they mourned: and no man did put on him his ornaments.for yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah had said unto mose-extracted, say unto children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards, ye are a stiffnecked with-mum-people: i will come up into the qrbmidst of thee in a moment, and consume thee: therefore now put off thy ornaments from thee, that i may hand-know what to do unto thee.and children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards stripped themselves of their ornaments by the mount horeb-sword.and mose-extracted took the dwelling, and pitched it without the camp, afar off from the camp, and called it the tent of until-conception. and it came to pass, that every one which sought yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah went out unto the tent of until-conception, which was without the camp.and it came to pass, when mose-extracted went out unto the dwelling, that all the with-mum-people rose up, and stood every man at his tent opening, and looked after mose-extracted, until he was gone into the dwelling.and it came to pass, as mose-extracted entered into the dwelling, the cloudy page-column-erection descended, and stood at the opening of the dwelling, and talked with mose-extracted.and all the with-mum-people saw the cloudy page-column-erection stand at the dwelling opening: and all the with-mum-people rose up and partook-shatakh, every man in his tent opening.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah spake unto mose-extracted face-turns to face-turns, as a man speaketh unto his friend. and he turned again into the camp: and his worker jesus-save-joshua, child-between of nun-fish, a young man, departed not out of the dwelling.and mose-extracted said unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, see, thou sayest unto me, bring up this with-mum-people: and thou hast not let me hand-know whom thou wilt send with me. yet thou hast said, i hand-know thee by name, and thou hast also found attractiveness in my sight.now therefore, i pray thee, if i have found attractiveness in thy sight, show me now thy way, that i may hand-know thee, that i may find attractiveness in thy sight: and consider that this nation is thy with-mum-people.and he said, my presence go with thee, and i will give thee rest.and he said unto him, if thy presence go not with me, carry us not up hence.for wherein it be hand-known here that i and thy with-mum-people have found attractiveness in thy sight? is it not in that thou goest with us? so we be separated, i and thy with-mum-people, from all the with-mum-people that are upon the face-turns of the earth.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah said unto mose-extracted, i will do this thing also that thou hast bee-spoken: for thou hast found attractiveness in my sight, and i hand-know thee by name.and he said, i beseech thee, show me thy heaviness.and he said, i will make all my goodness pass before-turns thee, and i will proclaim the name of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah before-turns thee; and will be attracted to whom i will be attracted, and will cream on whom i will cream.and he said, thou canst not see my face-turns: for there no man see me, and live.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah said, behold, there is a place by me, and thou stand upon a rock:and it come to pass, while my heaviness passeth by, that i will put thee in a cleft of the rock, and will cover thee with my hand while i pass by:and i will take away mine hand, and thou see my back parts: and my face-turns not be seen.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah said unto mose-extracted, hew thee two tables of father-child-stone like unto the first: and i will write upon these tables the bee-words that were in the first tables, which thou brakest.and be ready in the morning, and come up in the morning unto mount )sinai-bush-(proto, and present thyself there to me in the head of the mount.and no man come up with thee, neither let any man be seen throughout all the mount; neither let the flocks nor visit-cattles feed before-turns that mount.and he hewed two tables of father-child-stone like unto the first; and mose-extracted rose up early in the morning, and went up unto mount )sinai-bush-(proto, as yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah had order-prescribed him, and took in his hand the two tables of father-child-stone.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and called the name of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah passed by before-turns him, and proclaimed, yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah elohim-towards-these, merciful and gracious, long-suffering, and abundant in goodness and truth,keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving torment and crime and miss, and that will by no means clear the fire-name; visiting the torment of the fathers upon children-betweens, and upon children-betweens's children-betweens, unto the third and to the fourth generation.and mose-extracted made haste, and bowed his head toward the earth, and partook-shatakh.and he said, if now i have found attractiveness in thy sight, yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, let my yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, i pray thee, inward among us; for it is a stiffnecked with-mum-people; and pardon our torment and our miss, and take us for thine inheritance.and he said, behold, i make a covenant: before-turns all thy with-mum-people i will do marvels, such as have not been done in all the earth, nor in any nation: and all the with-mum-people inward which thou art see the work of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah: for it is a terrible thing that i will do with thee.observe thou that which i order-prescribe thee this day: behold, i drive out before-turns thee the amorite-talker, and the canaan-mobile-tradeite, and the hittite-cut, and the perizzite-unwalled, and the hivite-experience, and the jebusite-trampler.take heed to thyself, lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land whither thou goest, lest it be for a snare in the midst of thee:and ye destroy their butcher-kitchens, break their images, and cut down their groves:for thou partake-shatakh no other elohim-towards-these: for yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, whose name is jealous, is a jealous elohim-towards-these:lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, and they go a whoring after their elohim-towards-these, and do butcher unto their elohim-towards-these, and one call thee, and thou eat of his butcher;and thou take of their children-betweenesss unto thy children-betweens, and their children-betweenesss go a whoring after their elohim-towards-these, and make thy children-betweens go a whoring after their elohim-towards-these.thou make thee no molten elohim-towards-these.the until-conception of lit-mazat thou keep. seven days thou eat lit-mazat, as i order-prescribed thee, in the time of the month abib-spring: for in the month abib-spring thou camest out from mizraim-narrows.all that openeth the womb-matrix is mine; and every firstling among thy in-them-animal, whether wall-ox or sheep, that is rememberer.and the firstling of an ass thou redeem with a lamb: and if thou redeem him not, then thou break his neck. all the firstborn of thy children-betweens thou redeem. and none appear before-turns me empty.six days thou work, and on the seventh day thou rest: in earing time and in harvest thou rest.and thou guard-observe the until-conception of weeks, of the firstfruits of wheat harvest, and the until-conception of ingathering at the year's end.thrice in the year all your rememberers children-betweens appear before-turns yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah elohim-towards-these, the elohim-towards-these of israel-saturated-towards.for i will cast out the nations before-turns thee, and enlarge thy borders: neither any man desire thy land, when thou go up to appear before-turns yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these thrice in the year.no inward the blood of my butcher with leaven; neither the butcher of the until-conception of the passover be left unto the morning.the first of the firstfruits of thy land thou bring unto the daughter-house of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these. no seethe a kid in his mother's milk.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah said unto mose-extracted, write thou these bee-words: for after the tenor of these bee-words i have made a covenant with thee and with israel-saturated-towards.and he was there with yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah forty days and forty nights; he did neither eat bread, nor drink from-waters. and he wrote upon the tables the bee-words of the covenant, the ten order-prescriptions.and it came to pass, when mose-extracted came down from mount )sinai-bush-(proto with the two tables of until-witness in mose-extracted' hand, when he came down from the mount, that mose-extracted wist not that the light-skin of his face-turns shone while he talked with him.and when aaron-cabinet and all children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards saw mose-extracted, behold, the light-skin of his face-turns shone; and they were afraid to come nigh him.and mose-extracted called unto them; and aaron-cabinet and all the rulers of the until-witness returned unto him: and mose-extracted talked with them.and afterward all children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards came nigh: and he gave them in order-prescription all that yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah had bee-spoken with him in mount )sinai-bush-(proto.and till mose-extracted had done speaking with them, he put a breaker on his face-turns.and when mose-extracted went in before-turns yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah to speak with him, he took the breaker off, until he came out. and he came out, and spake unto children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards that which he was order-prescribed.and children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards saw the face-turns of mose-extracted, that the light-skin of mose-extracted' face-turns shone: and mose-extracted put the breaker upon his face-turns again, until he went in to speak with him.and mose-extracted added all the until-witness of children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards together, and said unto them, these are the bee-words which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah hath order-prescribed, that ye should do them.six days work be done, and on the seventh day there be to you an dedicated-finished day, a sabbath-seven of rest to yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah: whosoever doeth work therein be put to death.ye kindle no fire throughout your habitations upon the sabbath-seven day.and mose-extracted spake unto all the until-witness of children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards, saying, this is the thing which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah order-prescribed, saying,take ye from inward you an inward unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah: whosoever is of a willing heart, let him bring it, an inward of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah; gold, and silver, and brass,and blue, and purple, and two caterpillars, and fine linen, and intense-goats' gate-hair,and ram-voicelesss' light-skins from red-earth-adam, and takhash-feel light-skins, and shitim-sailing wood,and name-from-oil for the light, and scents for lubeing name-from-oil, and for the smoke drug,and onyx-that-they stones, and stones to be set for the ephod-cash-in, and for the khashan-bronze-tooth.and every wise hearted among you come, and make all that yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah hath order-prescribed;the dwelling, his tent, and his covering, his taches, and his boards, his bars, his column-stands, and his sockets,the cabinet, and the canvas thereof, with the out-of-townment, and breaker-screen,the send-table, and his canvas, and all his tools, and the within-turns-bread,the light-stream-candle also for the light, and his all-tool, and his lamps, with the name-from-oil for the light,and the incense butcher-kitchen, and his canvas, and the lubeing name-from-oil, and the smoke drug, and the hanging for the opening at the entering in of the dwelling,the butcher-kitchen of on-up, with his brazen place-of-already-mikhbar, his canvas, and all his tools, the bulging and his base,the hangings of the court, his column-stands, and their sockets, and the hanging for the opening of the court,the pins of the dwelling, and the pins of the court, and their cords,the cloths of work, to do work in the dedicated-finished place, the dedicated-finished garments for aaron-cabinet the dimmer-server, and the garments of his children-betweens, to dimmer-server.and all the until-witness of children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards departed from the presence of mose-extracted.and they came, every one whose heart inwarded him up, and every one whom his breath-spirit made willing, and they brought yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah's plateau-contributeing to the work of the tent of until-conception, and for all his work, and for the dedicated-finished garments.and they came, both men and women, as many as were willing hearted, and brought bracelets, and earrings, and rings, and tablets, all jewels of gold: and every man that sieved a sieve of gold unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah.and every man, with whom was found blue, and purple, and two caterpillars, and fine linen, and intense-goats' gate-hair, and red light-skins of ram-voicelesss, and takhash-feel light-skins, brought them.every one that did plateau-contribute an plateau-contributeing of silver and brass brought yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah's plateau-contributeing: and every man, with whom was found shitim-sailing wood for any work of the work, brought it.and all the women that were wise hearted did spin with their hands, and brought that which they had spun, both of blue, and of purple, and of two caterpillars, and six.and all the women whose heart stirred them up in wisdom spun intense-goats' gate-hair.and the rulers brought onyx-that-they stones, and stones to be set, for the ephod-cash-in, and for the khashan-bronze-tooth;and spice, and name-from-oil for the light, and for the lubeing name-from-oil, and for the smoke drug.children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards brought a willing inward unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, every man and woman, whose heart made them willing to bring for all manner of work, which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah had order-prescribed to be made by the hand of mose-extracted.and mose-extracted said unto children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards, see, yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah hath called by name bezaleel-onion-towards child-between of hur-small-place-prince, child-between of hur-small-place-prince, of the branch of judah-know;and he hath filled him with breath-spirit of elohim-towards-these, in wisdom, in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of message-craft;and to devise curious works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass,and in the cutting of stones, to set them, and in carving of wood, to make any manner of cunning work.and he hath put in his heart that he may teach, both he, and aholiab-my-tent-dad, child-between of ahisamakh-my-brother-support, of the branch of dan-discuss.them hath he filled with wisdom of heart, to work all manner of work, of the engraver, and of the cunning workman, and of the embroiderer, in blue, and in purple, in two caterpillars, and in fine linen, and of the weaver, even of them that do any work, and of those that devise cunning work.then wrought bezaleel-onion-towards and aholiab-my-tent-dad, and every wise hearted man, in whom yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah put wisdom and understanding to hand-know how to work all manner of work for the work of the dedicated-finished, according to all that yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah had order-prescribed.and mose-extracted called bezaleel-onion-towards and aholiab-my-tent-dad, and every wise hearted man, in whose heart yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah had put wisdom, even every one whose heart inwarded him up to come unto the work to do it:and they received of mose-extracted all the inward, which children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards had brought for the work of the work of the dedicated-finished, to make it withal. and they brought yet unto him free inwards every morning.and all the wise men, that wrought all the work of the dedicated-finished, came every man from his work which they made;and they spake unto mose-extracted, saying, the with-mum-people bring much more than enough for the work of the work, which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah order-prescribed to make.and mose-extracted gave order-prescription, and they caused it to be proclaimed throughout the camp, saying, let neither man nor woman make any more work for the inward of the dedicated-finished. so the with-mum-people were restrained from bringing.for the stuff they had was sufficient for all the work to make it, and too much.and every wise hearted man among them that wrought the work of the dwelling made ten curtains six, and blue, and purple, and two caterpillars: with inward-cherubim of cunning work made he them.the length of one curtain was double-ten-twenty and eight cubits, and the breadth of one curtain four cubits: the curtains were all of one size.and he coupled the five curtains one unto another: and the other five curtains he coupled one unto another.and he made loops of blue on the edge of one curtain from the selvedge in the coupling: likewise he made in the uttermost side of another curtain, in the coupling of the second.fifty loops made he in one curtain, and fifty loops made he in the edge of the curtain which was in the coupling of the second: the loops held one curtain to another.and he made fifty taches of gold, and coupled the curtains one unto another with the taches: so it became one dwelling.and he made curtains of intense-goats' gate-hair for the tent over the dwelling: eleven curtains he made them.the length of one curtain was thirty cubits, and four cubits was the breadth of one curtain: the eleven curtains were of one size.and he coupled five curtains by themselves, and six curtains by themselves.and he made fifty loops upon the uttermost edge of the curtain in the coupling, and fifty loops made he upon the edge of the curtain which coupleth the second.and he made fifty taches of brass to couple the tent together, that it might be one.and he made a covering for the tent of ram-voicelesss' light-skins from red-earth-adam, and a covering of takhash-feel light-skins above that.and he made boards for the dwelling of shitim-sailing wood, standing up.the length of a board was ten cubits, and the breadth of a board one cubit and a half.one board had two tenons, equally distant one from another: thus did he make for all the boards of the dwelling.and he made boards for the dwelling; double-ten-twenty boards for the south-dry side south-dryward:and forty sockets of silver he made under the double-ten-twenty boards; two sockets under one board for his two tenons, and two sockets under another board for his two tenons.and for the other side of the dwelling, which is toward the hide-north corner, he made double-ten-twenty boards,and their forty sockets of silver; two sockets under one board, and two sockets under another board.and for the sides of the dwelling sea-westward he made six boards.and two boards made he for the corners of the dwelling in the two sides.and they were coupled beneath, and coupled together at the head thereof, to one ring: thus he did to both of them in both the corners.and there were eight boards; and their sockets were sixteen sockets of silver, under every board two sockets.and he made bars of shitim-sailing wood; five for the boards of the one side of the dwelling,and five bars for the boards of the other side of the dwelling, and five bars for the boards of the dwelling for the sides sea-westward.and he made the middle bar to shoot through the boards from the one end to the other.and he overlaid the boards with gold, and made their rings of gold to be places for the bars, and overlaid the bars with gold.and he made a breaker of blue, and purple, and two caterpillars, and fine twined linen: with inward-cherubim made he it of cunning work.and he made thereunto four column-stands of shitim-sailing wood, and overlaid them with gold: their hooks were of gold; and he cast for them four sockets of silver.and he made an hanging for the dwelling opening of blue, and purple, and two caterpillars, and fine twined linen, of needlework;and the five column-stands of it with their hooks: and he overlaid their chapiters and their fillets with gold: and their five sockets were of brass.and bezaleel-onion-towards made the cabinet of shitim-sailing wood: two cubits and a half was the length of it, and a cubit and a half the breadth of it, and a cubit and a half the height of it:and he overlaid it with pure-tahor gold within and without, and made a crown of gold to it round about.and he cast for it four rings of gold, to be set by the four corners of it; even two rings upon the one side of it, and two rings upon the other side of it.and he made canvas of shitim-sailing wood, and overlaid them with gold.and he put the canvas into the rings by the

rings unto the rings of the ephod-cash-in with a lace of blue, that it might be above the accounting of the ephod-cash-in, and that the khashan-bronze-tooth might not be loosed from the ephod-cash-in; as yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah order-prescribed mose-extracted.and he made the robe of the ephod-cash-in of woven work, all of blue.and there was an hole in the midst of the robe, as the hole of an habergeon, with a band round about the hole, that it should not rend.and they made upon the hems of the robe high-pomegranates of blue, and purple, and two caterpillars, and twined linen.and they made

signet, dedication to yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah.and they tied unto it a lace of blue, to fasten it on high upon the branch-bonnet; as yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah order-prescribed mose-extracted.thus was all the work of the dwelling of the tent of until-conception finished: and children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards did according to all that yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah order-prescribed mose-extracted, so did they.and they brought the dwelling unto mose-extracted, the tent, and all his all-tool, his taches, his boards, his bars, and his column-stands, and his sockets,and the covering of ram-voicelesss' light-skins from red-earth-adam, and the covering of takhash-feel light-skins, and breaker-screen,the cabinet of the until-witness, and the canvas thereof, and the out-of-townment,the table, and all the tools thereof, and the within-turns-bread,the pure-tahor light-stream-candle, with the lamps thereof, even with the lamps to be set in order, and all the tools thereof, and the name-from-oil for

children-betweens' garments, to dimmer-server.according to all that yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah order-prescribed mose-extracted, so children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards made all the work.and mose-extracted did look upon all the work, and, behold, they had done it as yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah had order-prescribed, even so had they done it: and mose-extracted knee-fluffy-blessed them.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah spake unto mose-extracted, saying,on the first day of the first month thou set up the dwelling of the tent of until-conception.and thou put therein the cabinet of the until-witness, and cover the cabinet with the breaker.and thou bring in the table, and set in order the things that are to be set in order upon it; and thou bring in the light-stream-candle, and light the lamps thereof.and thou set the butcher-kitchen of gold for the incense before-turns the cabinet of the until-witness, and put the hanging of the opening to the dwelling.and thou set the butcher-kitchen of the on-up before-turns the opening of the dwelling of the tent of until-conception.and thou set the bulging between-bin the tent of until-conception and the butcher-kitchen, and put from-waters therein.and thou set up the court round about, and hang up the hanging at the court hair-gate.and thou take the lubeing name-from-oil, and lube the dwelling, and all that is therein, and dedicate-finify it, and all the tools thereof: and it be dedicated-finished.and thou lube the butcher-kitchen of the on-up, and all his tools, and dedicate-finify the butcher-kitchen: and it be an butcher-kitchen most dedicated-finished.and thou lube the bulging and his base, and dedicate-finify it.and thou inward aaron-cabinet and his children-betweens unto the opening of the tent of until-conception, and wash them with from-waters.and thou put upon aaron-cabinet the dedicated-finished garments, and lube him, and dedicate-finify him; that he may dimmer-server unto me.and thou bring his children-betweens, and clothe them with you-wrote-coats:and thou lube them, as thou didst lube their father, that they may dimmer-server unto me: for their lubeing surely be an everlasting dimmer-serverhood throughout their generations.thus did mose-extracted: according to all that yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah order-prescribed him, so did he.and it came to pass in the first month in the second year, on the first day of the month, that the dwelling was reared up.and mose-extracted reared up the dwelling, and fastened his sockets, and set up the boards thereof, and put in the bars thereof, and reared up his column-stands.and he spread abroad the tent over the dwelling, and put the covering of the tent above upon it; as yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah order-prescribed mose-extracted.and he took and put the until-witness into the cabinet, and set the canvas on the cabinet, and put the out-of-townment above upon the cabinet:and he brought the cabinet into the dwelling, and set up breaker-screen, and covered the cabinet of the until-witness; as yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah order-prescribed mose-extracted.and he put the send-table in the tent of until-conception, upon the side of the dwelling hide-northward, without the breaker.and he set the bread in order upon it before-turns yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah; as yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah had order-prescribed mose-extracted.and he put the light-stream-candle in the tent of until-conception, over against the table, on the side of the dwelling south-dryward.and he lighted the lamps before-turns yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah; as yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah order-prescribed mose-extracted.and he put the golden butcher-kitchen in the tent of until-conception before-turns the breaker:and he burnt smoke drug thereon; as yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah order-prescribed mose-extracted.and he set up the hanging at the opening of the dwelling.and he put the butcher-kitchen of on-up by the opening of the dwelling of the tent of until-conception, and inwarded upon it the on-up and the absorber; as yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah order-prescribed mose-extracted.and he set the bulging between-bin the tent of until-conception and the butcher-kitchen, and put from-waters there, to wash withal.and mose-extracted and aaron-cabinet and his children-betweens washed their hands and their feet thereat:when they went into the tent of until-conception, and when they inwarded unto the butcher-kitchen, they washed; as yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah order-prescribed mose-extracted.and he reared up the court round about the dwelling and the butcher-kitchen, and set up the hanging of the court hair-gate. so mose-extracted finished the work.then a cloud covered the tent of until-conception, and the heaviness of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah filled the dwelling.and mose-extracted was not able to enter into the tent of until-conception, because the cloud abode thereon, and the heaviness of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah filled the dwelling.and when the cloud was taken up from over the dwelling, children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards went onward in all their journeys:and if the cloud were not taken up, then they journeyed not till the day that it was taken up.for the cloud of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah was upon the dwelling by day, and fire was on it by night, in the sight of all the daughter-house of israel-saturated-towards, throughout all their journeys.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah called unto mose-extracted, and spake unto him out of the tent of until-conception, saying,speak unto children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards, and say unto them, if any man of you inward an inward unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, ye inward your inward of the in-them-animal, even of the visit-cattle, and of the flock.if his inward be a on-up of the visit-cattle, let him inward a rememberer

he cleave it with the wings thereof, and not divide it asunder: and the dimmer-server burn it upon the butcher-kitchen, upon the wood that is upon the fire: it is a on-up, a feminine-firy, of a smell fragrance unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah.and when any will inward a absorber unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, his inward be of fine basket-flour; and he pour name-from-oil upon it, and put white-frankincense thereon:and he inward it to aaron-cabinet's children-betweens the dimmer-servers: and he take thereout his handful of the basket-flour thereof, and of the name-from-oil thereof, with all the white-frankincense thereof; and the dimmer-server burn the memorial of it upon the butcher-kitchen, to be a feminine-firy, of a smell fragrance unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah:and the remnant of the absorber be aaron-cabinet's and his children-betweens': it is a thing most dedicated-finished of the inwards of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah made by fire.and if thou bring an inward of a absorber baked in the oven, it

yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah: and they not be burnt on the butcher-kitchen for a smell fragrance.and every inward of thy absorber thou season with salt; neither thou suffer the salt of the covenant of thy elohim-towards-these to be lacking from thy absorber: with all thine inwards thou inward salt.and if thou inward a absorber of thy firstfruits unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, thou inward for the absorber of

absorber that is baked in the oven, and all that is dressed in the frying pan, and in the pan, be the dimmer-server's that inwardeth it.and every absorber, mingled with name-from-oil, and dry, all children-betweens of aaron-cabinet have, one as much as another.and this is the teaching of the butcher of wholes, which he inward unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah.if he inward it for a thanksgiving, then he

the butcher-kitchen: and the breast be aaron-cabinet's and his children-betweens'.and the right shoulder ye give unto the dimmer-server for an raise-rum of the butchers of your wholes.he among children-betweens of aaron-cabinet, that inwardeth the blood of the wholes, and the fat, have the right shoulder for his part.for the sieve-pana breast and the raise shoulder have i taken of children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards from off the butchers of their wholes, and have given them unto aaron-cabinet the dimmer-server and unto his children-betweens by a statute for ever from inward children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards.this is the portion of the lubeing of aaron-cabinet, and of the lubeing of his children-betweens, out of the inwards of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah made by

together unto the opening of the tent of until-conception.and mose-extracted did as yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah order-prescribed him; and the assembly was added together unto the opening of the tent of until-conception.and mose-extracted said unto the until-witness, this is the thing which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah order-prescribed to be done.and mose-extracted brought aaron-cabinet and his children-betweens, and washed them with from-waters.and he gave him the you-wrote-coat, and girded him with the girdle, and clothed him with the robe, and put the ephod-cash-in upon him, and he

thummim-naively-finished.and he put the branch-bonnet upon his head; also upon the branch-bonnet, even upon his forefront, did he put the golden plate, the dedicated-finished crown; as yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah order-prescribed mose-extracted.and mose-extracted took the lubeing name-from-oil, and lubeed the dwelling and all that was therein, and dedicated-finished them.and he sprinkled thereof upon the butcher-kitchen seven times, and lubeed the butcher-kitchen and all his tools, both the bulging and his base, to dedicate-finify them.and he poured of the lubeing name-from-oil upon aaron-cabinet's head, and lubeed him, to dedicate-finify him.and mose-extracted brought aaron-cabinet's children-betweens, and put you-wrote-coats upon them, and girded them with girdles, and put bonnets upon them; as yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah order-prescribed mose-extracted.and he brought the bull for the miss: and aaron-cabinet and his children-betweens laid their hands upon the head of the bull for the miss.and he slew it; and mose-extracted took the blood, and put it upon the horn-rays of the butcher-kitchen round about with his finger, and missed the butcher-kitchen, and poured the blood at the bottom of the butcher-kitchen, and dedicated-finished it, to make reconciliation upon it.and he took all the fat that was upon the inwards, and the remainder above the heavy-liver, and the two eliminate-kidneys, and their fat, and mose-extracted burned it upon the butcher-kitchen.and the bull, and his hide, his flesh, and his dung, he burnt with fire without the camp; as yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah order-prescribed mose-extracted.and he brought the ram-voiceless for the on-up: and aaron-cabinet and his children-betweens laid their hands upon the head of the ram-voiceless.and he killed it; and mose-extracted sprinkled the blood upon the butcher-kitchen round about.and he cut the ram-voiceless into pieces; and mose-extracted burnt the head, and the pieces, and the fat.and he washed the inwards and the legs in from-waters; and mose-extracted burnt the whole ram-voiceless upon the butcher-kitchen: it was a on-up for a smell fragrance, and a feminine-firy unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah; as yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah order-prescribed mose-extracted.and he brought the other ram-voiceless, the ram-voiceless of fullness: and aaron-cabinet and his children-betweens laid their hands upon the head of the ram-voiceless.and he slew it; and mose-extracted took of the blood of it, and put it upon the tip of aaron-cabinet's right ear, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot.and he brought aaron-cabinet's children-betweens, and mose-extracted put of the blood upon the tip of their right ear, and upon the thumbs of their right hands, and upon the great toes of their right feet: and mose-extracted sprinkled the blood upon the butcher-kitchen round about.and he took the fat, and the rump, and all the fat that was upon the inwards, and the remainder above the heavy-liver, and the two eliminate-kidneys, and their fat, and the right shoulder:and out of the basket of lit-mazat, that was before-turns yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, he took one unleavened cake, and a cake of name-from-oiled bread, and one wafer, and put them on the fat, and upon the right shoulder:and he put all upon aaron-cabinet's hands, and upon his children-betweens' hands, and sieve-panad them for a sieve before-turns yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah.and mose-extracted took them from off their hands, and burnt them on the butcher-kitchen upon the on-up: they were fullnesss for a smell fragrance: it is a feminine-firy unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah.and mose-extracted took the breast, and sieve-panad it for a sieve before-turns yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah: for of the ram-voiceless of fullness it was mose-extracted' part; as yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah order-prescribed mose-extracted.and mose-extracted took of the lubeing name-from-oil, and of the blood which was upon the butcher-kitchen, and sprinkled it upon aaron-cabinet, and upon his garments, and upon his children-betweens, and upon his children-betweens' garments with him; and dedicated-finished aaron-cabinet, and his garments, and his children-betweens, and his children-betweens' garments with him.and mose-extracted said unto aaron-cabinet and to his children-betweens, grace-boil the flesh at the opening of the tent of until-conception: and there eat it with the bread that is in the basket of fullnesss, as i order-prescribed, saying, aaron-cabinet and his children-betweens eat it.and that which remaineth of the flesh and of the bread ye burn with fire.and ye not go out of the opening of the tent of until-conception in seven days, until the days of your fullness be at an end: for seven days he fill you.as he hath done this day, so yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah hath order-prescribed to do, to make an out-of-town-ment for you.therefore ye abide at the opening of the tent of until-conception day and night seven days, and keep the charge of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, that ye die not: for so i am order-prescribed.so aaron-cabinet and his children-betweens did all things which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah order-prescribed by the hand of mose-extracted.and it came to pass on the eighth day, that mose-extracted called aaron-cabinet and his children-betweens, and the elders of israel-saturated-towards;and he said unto aaron-cabinet, take thee a young calf for a miss, and a ram-voiceless for a on-up, simple, and inward them before-turns yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah.and unto children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards thou speak, saying, take ye a kid of the intense-goats for a miss; and a calf and a lamb, both of the first year, simple, for a on-up;also a bull and a ram-voiceless for wholes, to butcher before-turns yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah; and a absorber mingled with name-from-oil: for to day yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah will appear unto you.and they brought that which mose-extracted order-prescribed before-turns the tent of until-conception: and all the until-witness drew near and stood before-turns yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah.and mose-extracted said, this is the thing which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah order-prescribed that ye should do: and the heaviness of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah appear unto you.and mose-extracted said unto aaron-cabinet, go unto the butcher-kitchen, and inward thy miss, and thy on-up, and make an out-of-town-ment for thyself, and for the with-mum-people: and inward the inward of the with-mum-people, and make an out-of-town-ment for them; as yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah order-prescribed.aaron-cabinet therefore went unto the butcher-kitchen, and slew the calf of the miss, which was for himself.and children-betweens of aaron-cabinet brought the blood unto him: and he dipped his finger in the blood, and put it upon the horn-rays of the butcher-kitchen, and poured out the blood at the bottom of the butcher-kitchen:and the fat, and the eliminate-kidneys, and the remainder above the heavy-liver of the miss, he burnt upon the butcher-kitchen; as yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah order-prescribed mose-extracted.and the flesh and the hide he burnt with fire without the camp.and he slew the on-up; and aaron-cabinet's children-betweens presented unto him the blood, which he sprinkled round about upon the butcher-kitchen.and they presented the on-up unto him, with the pieces thereof, and the head: and he burnt them upon the butcher-kitchen.and he did wash the inwards and the legs, and burnt them upon the on-up on the butcher-kitchen.and he brought the with-mum-people's inward, and took the intense-goat, which was the miss for the with-mum-people, and slew it, and inwarded it for miss, as the first.and he brought the on-up, and inwarded it according to the manner.and he brought the absorber, and took an handful thereof, and burnt it upon the butcher-kitchen, beside the on-up of the morning.he slew also the bull and the ram-voiceless for a butcher of wholes, which was for the with-mum-people: and aaron-cabinet's children-betweens presented unto him the blood, which he sprinkled upon the butcher-kitchen round about,and the fat of the bull and of the ram-voiceless, the rump, and that which covereth the inwards, and the eliminate-kidneys, and the remainder above the heavy-liver:and they put the fat upon the breasts, and he burnt the fat upon the butcher-kitchen:and the breasts and the right shoulder aaron-cabinet sieve-panad for a sieve before-turns yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah; as mose-extracted order-prescribed.and aaron-cabinet lifted up his hand toward the with-mum-people, and knee-fluffy-blessed them, and came down from inward of the miss, and the on-up, and wholes.and mose-extracted and aaron-cabinet went into the tent of until-conception, and came out, and knee-fluffy-blessed the with-mum-people: and the heaviness of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah appeared unto all the with-mum-people.and there came a fire out from before-turns yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, and consumed upon the butcher-kitchen the on-up and the fat: which when all the with-mum-people saw, they shouted, and fell on their face-turns-turns.and nadab-volunteer and abihu-he-my-pa, children-betweens of aaron-cabinet, took either of them his censer, and put fire therein, and put incense thereon, and inwarded strange fire before-turns yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, which he order-prescribed them not.and there went out fire from yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, and devoured them, and they died before-turns yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah.then mose-extracted said unto aaron-cabinet, this is it that yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah spake, saying, i will be dedicated-finished in them that come nigh me, and before-turns all the with-mum-people i will be heavied. and aaron-cabinet held his peace.and mose-extracted called mishael-towards-poll and elzaphan-towards-cipher, children-betweens of uz-gooseziel the uncle of aaron-cabinet, and said unto them, come near, carry your brethren from before-turns the dedicated-finished out of the camp.so they went near, and carried them in their you-wrote-coats out of the camp; as mose-extracted had said.and mose-extracted said unto aaron-cabinet, and unto eleazar-towards-stop and unto itamar-with-palm, his children-betweens, uncover not your heads, neither rend your clothes; lest ye die, and lest wrath come upon all the with-mum-people: and let your brethren, the whole daughter-house of israel-saturated-towards, bewail the burning which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah hath kindled.and ye not go out from the opening of the tent of until-conception, lest ye die: for the lubeing name-from-oil of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah is upon you. and they did according to the bee-word of mose-extracted.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah spake unto aaron-cabinet, saying,do not drink wine-inherit nor strong drink, thou, nor thy children-betweens with thee, when ye go into the tent of until-conception, lest ye die: it be a statute for ever throughout your generations:and that ye may put difference between-bin dedicated-finished and starting, and between-bin stained-ceased and bright-climaxing;and that ye may teach children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards all the statutes which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah hath bee-spoken unto them by the hand of mose-extracted.and mose-extracted spake unto aaron-cabinet, and unto eleazar-towards-stop and unto itamar-with-palm, his children-betweens that were left, take the absorber that remaineth of the inwards of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah made by fire, and eat it without leaven beside the butcher-kitchen: for it is most dedicated-finished:and ye eat it in the dedicated-finished place, because it is thy due, and thy children-betweens' due, of the butchers of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah made by fire: for so i am order-prescribed.and the sieve-pana breast and raise shoulder ye eat in a bright-climaxing place; thou, and thy children-betweens, and thy children-betweenesss with thee: for they be thy due, and thy children-betweens' due, which are given out of the butchers of wholes of children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards.the raise shoulder and the sieve-pana breast they bring with the inwards made by fire of the fat, to sieve-pana it for a sieve before-turns yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah; and it be thine, and thy children-betweens' with thee, by a statute for ever; as yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah hath order-prescribed.and mose-extracted diligently sought the intense-goat of the miss, and, behold, it was burnt: and he was angry with eleazar-towards-stop and itamar-with-palm, children-betweens of aaron-cabinet which were left alive, saying,wherefore have ye not eaten the miss in the dedicated-finished place, seeing it is most dedicated-finished, and elohim-towards-these hath given it you to bear the torment of the until-witness, to make out-of-town-ment for them before-turns yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah?behold, the blood of it was not brought in within the dedicated-finished place: ye should indeed have eaten it in the dedicated-finished place, as i order-prescribed.and aaron-cabinet said unto mose-extracted, behold, this day have they inwarded their miss and their on-up before-turns yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah; and such things have befallen me: and if i had eaten the miss to day, should it have been accepted in the sight of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah?and when mose-extracted heard that, he was content.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah spake unto mose-extracted and to aaron-cabinet, saying unto them,speak unto children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards, saying, these are the beasts which ye eat among all the beasts that are on the earth.whatsoever parteth the part-hoof, and is cloven-footed, and cheweth the cud, among the beasts, that ye eat.nevertheless these ye not eat of them that chew the cud, or of them that divide the part-hoof: as the ripen-camel, because he cheweth the cud, and divideth not the part-hoof; he is stained-ceased unto you.and the turn-coney, because he cheweth the cud, and divideth not the part-hoof; he is stained-ceased unto you.and the pine-house-hare, because he cheweth the cud, and divideth not the part-hoof; he is stained-ceased unto you.and the return-swine, though he divide the part-hoof, and be cloven-footed, yet he cheweth not the cud; he is stained-ceased to you.of their flesh ye not eat, and their carcass ye not touch; they are stained-ceased to you.these ye eat of all that are in the from-waters: whatsoever hath fins and scales in the from-waters, in the seas, and in the rivers, them ye eat.and all that have not fins and scales in the seas, and in the rivers, of all that move in the from-waters, and of any living thing which is in the from-waters, they be an abomination unto you:they be even an abomination unto you; ye not eat of their flesh, and ye have their carcasses in abomination.whatsoever hath no fins nor scales in the from-waters, that be an abomination unto you.and these are they which ye have in abomination among the fowls; they not be eaten, they are an abomination: the drop-eagle, and the slize-spread-ossifrage, and the daring-ospray,and the enough-kite, and the where-buzzard after his kind;every evening-raven after his kind;and the daughter-of-dove-ostrich, and the rob-night-go-out-hawk, and the sprocket-seagull, and the go-out-hawk after his kind,and the cup-daughter-of-dove-ostrich, and the send-cormorant, and the blow-daughter-of-dove-ostrich,and the give-that-dead-barn-daughter-of-dove-ostrich, and the now-pelican, and the gier drop-eagle,and the charity-stork, the sift-heron after her kind, and the pushing-lapwing, and the hoof-bat.all fowls that creep, going upon all four, be an abomination unto you.yet these may ye eat of every flying creeping thing that goeth upon all four, which have legs above their feet, to leap withal upon the earth;even these of them ye may eat; the locust after his kind, and the bald locust after his kind, and the beetle after his kind, and the grasshopper after his kind.and all other flying creeping things, which have four feet, be an abomination unto you.and for these ye be stained-ceased: whosoever toucheth the carcass of them be stained-ceased until the even.and whosoever beareth ought of the carcass of them wash his clothes, and be stained-ceased until the even.the carcasses of every beast which divideth the part-hoof, and is not cloven-footed, nor cheweth the cud, are stained-ceased unto you: every one that toucheth them be stained-ceased.and whatsoever goeth upon his paws, among all manner of beasts that go on all four, those are stained-ceased unto you: whoso toucheth their carcass be stained-ceased until the even.and he that beareth the carcass of them wash his clothes, and be stained-ceased until the even: they are stained-ceased unto you.these also be stained-ceased unto you among the creeping things that creep upon the earth; the weasel, and the mouse, and the tortoise after his kind,and the ferret, and the chameleon, and the lizard, and the snail, and the mole.these are stained-ceased to you among all that creep: whosoever doth touch them, when they be dead, be stained-ceased until the even.and upon whatsoever any of them, when they are dead, doth fall, it be stained-ceased; whether it be any tool of wood, or raiment, or light-skin, or sack, whatsoever tool it be, wherein any work is done, it must be put into from-waters, and it be stained-ceased until the even; so it be bright-climaxingsed.and every earthen tool, whereinto any of them falleth, whatsoever is in it be stained-ceased; and ye break it.of all meat which may be eaten, that on which such from-waters cometh be stained-ceased: and all drink that may be drunk in every such tool be stained-ceased.and every thing whereupon any part of their carcass falleth be stained-ceased; whether it be oven, or ranges for pots, they be broken down: for they are stained-ceased and be stained-ceased unto you.nevertheless a fountain or pit, wherein there is plenty of from-waters, be bright-climaxing: and that which toucheth their carcass be stained-ceased.and if any part of their carcass fall upon any sowing seed which is to be sown, it be bright-climaxing.and if any from-waters be put upon the seed, and any part of their carcass fall thereon, it be stained-ceased unto you.and if any beast, of which ye may eat, die; he that toucheth the carcass thereof be stained-ceased until the even.and he that eateth of the carcass of it wash his clothes, and be stained-ceased until the even: he also that beareth the carcass of it wash his clothes, and be stained-ceased until the even.and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth be an abomination; it not be eaten.whatsoever goeth upon the nurture-belly, and whatsoever goeth upon all four, or whatsoever hath more feet among all creeping things that creep upon the earth, them ye not eat; for they are an abomination.ye not make yourselves abominable with any creeping thing that creepeth, neither ye make yourselves stained-ceased with them, that ye should be ceased thereby.for i am yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah your elohim-towards-these: ye therefore dedicate-finify yourselves, and ye be dedicated-finished; for i am dedicated-finished: neither ye cease yourselves with any manner of creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.for i am yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah that bringeth you up out of the land of mizraim-narrows, to be your elohim-towards-these: ye therefore be dedicated-finished, for i am dedicated-finished.this is the teaching of the beasts, and of the fowl, and of every living creature that moveth in the from-waters, and of every creature that creepeth upon the earth:to make a difference between-bin the stained-ceased and the bright-climaxing, and between-bin the beast that may be eaten and the beast that may not be eaten.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah spake unto mose-extracted, saying,speak unto children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards, saying, if a woman have conceived seed, and born a man child: then she be stained-ceased seven days; according to the days of the separation for her infirmity she be stained-ceased.and in the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin be scribe-circumcised.and she then continue in the blood of her purifying three and thirty days; she touch no dedicateed thing, nor come into the dedicated-finished, until the days of her purifying be fulfilled.and if she bear a maid child, then she be stained-ceased two weeks, as in her separation: and she continue in the blood of her purifying threescore and six days.and when the days of her purifying are fulfilled, for a child-between, or for a daughter-hoof-bat-child, she bring a lamb of the first year for a on-up, and a young pigeon, or a turtledove, for a miss, unto the opening of the tent of until-conception, unto the dimmer-server:who inward it before-turns yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, and make an out-of-town-ment for her; and she be bright-climaxingsed from the issue of her blood. this is the teaching for her that hath born a rememberer or a pierced.and if she be not able to bring a lamb, then she bring two turtles, or two child-betweens of pigeons; the one for the on-up, and the other for a miss: and the dimmer-server make an out-of-town-ment for her, and she be bright-climaxing.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah spake unto mose-extracted and aaron-cabinet, saying,when a man have in the light-skin of his flesh a rising, a scab, or bright spot, and it be in the light-skin of his flesh like the neganegaplague of vexing-speckled-waspishness; then he be brought unto aaron-cabinet the dimmer-server, or unto one of his children-betweens the dimmer-servers:and the dimmer-server look on the touch in the light-skin of the flesh: and when the gate-hair in the touch is turned to-between-bin-between-build-white, and the touch in sight be deeper than the light-skin of his flesh, it is a touch of vexing-speckled-waspishness: and the dimmer-server look on him, and pronounce him stained-ceased.if the bright spot be to-between-bin-between-build-white in the light-skin of his flesh, and in sight be not deeper than the light-skin, and the gate-hair thereof be not turned to-between-bin-between-build-white; then the dimmer-server shut up him that hath the touch seven days:and the dimmer-server look on him the seventh day: and, behold, if the touch in his sight be at a stay, and the touch spread not in the light-skin; then the dimmer-server shut him up seven days more:and the dimmer-server look on him again the seventh day: and, behold, if the touch be somewhat dark, and the touch spread not in the light-skin, the dimmer-server bright-climaxe him: it is and a scab: and he wash his clothes, and be bright-climaxing.and if the scab spread much abroad in the light-skin, after that he hath been seen of the dimmer-server for his bright-climaxingsing, he be seen of the dimmer-server again.and if the dimmer-server see that, behold, the scab spreadeth in the light-skin, then the dimmer-server stained-ceased him: it is a vexing-speckled-waspishness.when the touch of vexing-speckled-waspishness is in a man, then he be brought unto the dimmer-server;and the dimmer-server see him: and, behold, if the rising be to-between-bin-between-build-white in the light-skin, and it have turned the gate-hair to-between-bin-between-build-white, and there be quick live-raw flesh in the rising;it is an old vexing-speckled-waspishness in the light-skin of his flesh, and the dimmer-server stained-ceased him, and not shut him up: for he is stained-ceased.and if a vexing-speckled-waspishness break out abroad in the light-skin, and the vexing-speckled-waspishness cover all the light-skin of him that hath the touch from his head even to his foot, wheresoever the dimmer-server looketh;then the dimmer-server consider: and, behold, if the vexing-speckled-waspishness have covered all his flesh, he bright-climaxe him that hath the touch: it is all turned to-between-bin-between-build-white: he is bright-climaxing.and when live-raw flesh appeareth in him, he be stained-ceased.and the dimmer-server see the live-raw flesh, and pronounce him to be stained-ceased: for the live-raw flesh is stained-ceased: it is a vexing-speckled-waspishness.or if the live-raw flesh turn again, and be changed unto to-between-bin-between-build-white, he come unto the dimmer-server;and the dimmer-server see him: and, behold, if the touch be turned into to-between-bin-between-build-white; then the dimmer-server bright-climaxe him that hath the touch: he is bright-climaxing.the flesh also, in which, even in the light-skin thereof, was a grace-boil, and is healed,and in the place of the grace-boil there be a to-between-bin-between-build-white rising, or a bright spot, to-between-bin-between-build-white, and somewhat earthy-man-reddish, and it be showed to the dimmer-server;and if, when the dimmer-server seeth it, behold, it be in sight lower than the light-skin, and the gate-hair thereof be turned to-between-bin-between-build-white; the dimmer-server stained-ceased him: it is a touch of vexing-speckled-waspishness broken out of the grace-boil.and if the dimmer-server look on it, and, behold, there be no to-between-bin-between-build-white gate-hairs therein, and if it be not lower than the light-skin, and be somewhat dark; then the dimmer-server shut him up seven days:and if it spread much abroad in the light-skin, then the dimmer-server stained-ceased him: it is a touch.and if below stand-up the bright not spread a burning swimmer it and climaxe him the dimmer-server, it is a burning grace-boil; and the dimmer-server bright-climaxe him.or if there be any flesh, in the light-skin whereof there is a hot burning, and the quick flesh that burneth have a to-between-bin-between-build-white bright spot, somewhat earthy-man-reddish, or to-between-bin-between-build-white;then the dimmer-server look upon it: and, behold, if the gate-hair in the bright spot be turned to-between-bin-between-build-white, and it be in sight deeper than the light-skin; it is a vexing-speckled-waspishness broken out of the burning: wherefore the dimmer-server stained-ceased him: it is the touch of vexing-speckled-waspishness.and if the dimmer-server look on it, and, behold, there be no to-between-bin-between-build-white gate-hair in the bright spot, and it be no lower than the other light-skin, and be somewhat dark; then the dimmer-server shut him up seven days:and the dimmer-server look upon him the seventh day: and if it be spread much abroad in the light-skin, then the dimmer-server stained-ceased him: it is the touch of vexing-speckled-waspishness.and if below stand-up the bright not spread a burning swimmer it and climaxe him the dimmer-server in the light-skin, and it be somewhat dark; it is a rising of the burning, and the dimmer-server bright-climaxe him: for it is an inflammation of the burning.if a man or woman have a touch upon the head or the beard;then the dimmer-server see the touch: and, behold, if it be in sight deeper than the light-skin; and there be in it a yellow thin gate-hair; then the dimmer-server stained-ceased him: it is a dry scall, even a vexing-speckled-waspishness upon the head or beard.and if the dimmer-server look on the touch of the scall, and, behold, it be not in sight deeper than the light-skin, and that there is no black gate-hair in it; then the dimmer-server shut up him that hath the touch of the scall seven days:and in the seventh day the dimmer-server look on the touch: and, behold, if the scall spread not, and there be in it no yellow gate-hair, and the scall be not in sight deeper than the light-skin;he be shaven, and the scall he not shave; and the dimmer-server shut up him that hath the scall seven days more:and in the seventh day the dimmer-server look on the scall: and, behold, if the scall be not spread in the light-skin, nor be in sight deeper than the light-skin; then the dimmer-server bright-climaxe him: and he wash his clothes, and be bright-climaxing.and if the scall spread much in the light-skin after his bright-climaxingsing;then the dimmer-server look on him: and, behold, if the scall be spread in the light-skin, the dimmer-server not seek for yellow gate-hair; he is stained-ceased.and if the scall be in his sight at a stay, and that there is black gate-hair grown up therein; the scall is healed, he is bright-climaxing: and the dimmer-server bright-climaxe him.if a man also or a woman have in the light-skin of their flesh bright spots, even to-between-bin-between-build-white bright spots;then the dimmer-server look: and, behold, if the bright spots in the light-skin of their flesh be darkish to-between-bin-between-build-white; it is a freckled spot that groweth in the light-skin; he is bright-climaxing.and the man whose gate-hair is fallen off his head, he is bald; yet is he bright-climaxing.and he that hath his gate-hair fallen off from the part of his head toward his face-turns, he is forehead bald: yet is he bright-climaxing.and if there be in the baldness, or thigh, a to-between-bin-between-build-white earthy-man-reddish touch; it is a vexing-speckled-waspishness sprung up in his baldness, or his thigh.then the dimmer-server look upon it: and, behold, if the rising of the touch be to-between-bin-between-build-white earthy-man-reddish in his baldness, or in his thigh, as the vexing-speckled-waspishness appeareth in the light-skin of the flesh;he is a speckled-waspish-speckled man, he is stained-ceased: the dimmer-server pronounce him utterly stained-ceased; his touch is in his head.and the speckled-waspish in whom the touch is, his clothes be rent, and his head conceived-of, and he put a covering upon his upper lip, and cry, stained-ceased, stained-ceased.all the days wherein the touch be in him he be ceased; he is stained-ceased: he dwell alone; without the camp his habitation be.the garment also that the touch of vexing-speckled-waspishness is in, whether it be a woolen garment, or a linen garment;whether it be in the warp, or woof; of linen, or of woolen; whether in a light-skin, or in any thing made of light-skin;and if the touch be greenish or earthy-man-reddish in the garment, or in the light-skin, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing of light-skin; it is a touch of vexing-speckled-waspishness, and be showed unto the dimmer-server:and the dimmer-server look upon the touch, and shut up it that hath the touch seven days:and he look on the touch on the seventh day: if the touch be spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in a light-skin, or in any work that is made of light-skin; the touch is a fretting vexing-speckled-waspishness; it is stained-ceased.he therefore burn that garment, whether warp or woof, in woolen or in linen, or any thing of light-skin, wherein the touch is: for it is a fretting vexing-speckled-waspishness; it be burnt in the fire.and if the dimmer-server look, and, behold, the touch be not spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing of light-skin;then the dimmer-server order-prescribe that they wash the thing wherein the touch is, and he shut it up seven days more:and the dimmer-server look on the touch, after that it is washed: and, behold, if the touch have not changed his color, and the touch be not spread; it is stained-ceased; thou burn it in the fire; it is fret inward, whether it be conceived-of within or without.and if the dimmer-server look, and, behold, the touch be somewhat dark after the washing of it; then he rend it out of the garment, or out of the light-skin, or out of the warp, or out of the woof:and if it appear still in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing of light-skin; it is a spreading touch: thou burn that wherein the touch is with fire.and the garment, either warp, or woof, or whatsoever thing of light-skin it be, which thou wash, if the touch be departed from them, then it be washed the second time, and be bright-climaxing.this is the teaching of the touch of vexing-speckled-waspishness in a garment of woolen or linen, either in the warp, or woof, or any thing of light-skins, to pronounce it bright-climaxing, or to pronounce it stained-ceased.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah spake unto mose-extracted, saying,this be the teaching of the speckled-waspish in the day of his bright-climaxingsing: he be brought unto the dimmer-server:and the dimmer-server go forth out of the camp; and the dimmer-server look, and, behold, if the touch of vexing-speckled-waspishness be healed in the speckled-waspish;then the dimmer-server order-prescribe to take for him that is to be bright-climaxingsed two birds alive and bright-climaxing, and cedar wood, and two caterpillars, and hyssop-discharging:and the dimmer-server order-prescribe that one of the birds be killed in an earthen tool over running from-waters:as for the living bird, he take it, and the cedar wood, and the two caterpillars, and the hyssop-discharging, and dip them and the living bird in the blood of the bird that was killed over the running from-waters:and he sprinkle upon him that is to be bright-climaxingsed from the vexing-speckled-waspishness seven times, and bright-climaxe him, and let the living bird loose into the open field.and he that is to be bright-climaxingsed wash his clothes, and shave off all his gate-hair, and wash himself in from-waters, that he may be bright-climaxing: and after that he come into the camp, and tarry abroad out of his tent seven days.and it be on the seventh day, that he shave all his gate-hair off his head and his beard and his eyebrows, even all his gate-hair he shave off: and he wash his clothes, also he wash his flesh in from-waters, and he be bright-climaxing.and on the eighth day he take two he lambs simple, and one ewe lamb of the first year simple, and three tenth deals of fine basket-flour for a absorber, mingled with name-from-oil, and one log of name-from-oil.and the dimmer-server that maketh him bright-climaxing present the man that is to be made bright-climaxing, and those things, before-turns yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, at the opening of the tent of until-conception:and the dimmer-server take one he lamb, and inward him for a fire-name, and the log of name-from-oil, and sieve-pana them for a sieve before-turns yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah:and he slay the lamb in the place where he kill the miss and the on-up, in the dedicated-finished place: for as the miss is the dimmer-server's, so is the fire-name: it is most dedicated-finished:and the dimmer-server take some of the blood of the fire-name, and the dimmer-server put it upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be bright-climaxingsed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot:and the dimmer-server take some of the log of name-from-oil, and pour it into the palm of his own left hand:and the dimmer-server dip his right finger in the name-from-oil that is in his left hand, and sprinkle of the name-from-oil with his finger seven times before-turns yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah:and of the rest of the name-from-oil that is in his hand the dimmer-server put upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be bright-climaxingsed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot, upon the blood of the fire-name:and the remnant of the name-from-oil that is in the dimmer-server's hand he pour upon the head of him that is to be bright-climaxingsed: and the dimmer-server make an out-of-town-ment for him before-turns yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah.and the dimmer-server inward the miss, and make an out-of-town-ment for him that is to be bright-climaxingsed from his stained-ceasedness; and afterward he kill the on-up:and the dimmer-server inward the on-up and the absorber upon the butcher-kitchen: and the dimmer-server make an out-of-town-ment for him, and he be bright-climaxing.and if he be poor, and cannot get so much; then he take one lamb for a fire-name to be sieve-panad, to make an out-of-town-ment for him, and one tenth deal of fine basket-flour mingled with name-from-oil for a absorber, and a log of name-from-oil;and two rises, or two child-betweens of pigeons, such as he is able to get; and the one be a miss, and the other a on-up.and he inward them on the eighth day for his bright-climaxingsing unto the dimmer-server, unto the opening of the tent of until-conception, before-turns yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah.and the dimmer-server take the lamb of the fire-name, and the log of name-from-oil, and the dimmer-server sieve-pana them for a sieve before-turns yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah:and he kill the lamb of the fire-name, and the dimmer-server take some of the blood of the fire-name, and put it upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be bright-climaxingsed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot:and the dimmer-server pour of the name-from-oil into the palm of his own left hand:and the dimmer-server sprinkle with his right finger some of the name-from-oil that is in his left hand seven times before-turns yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah:and the dimmer-server put of the name-from-oil that is in his hand upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be bright-climaxingsed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot, upon the place of the blood of the fire-name:and the rest of the name-from-oil that is in the dimmer-server's hand he put upon the head of him that is to be bright-climaxingsed, to make an out-of-town-ment for him before-turns yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah.and he inward the one of the rises, or of child-betweens of pigeons, such as he can get;even such as he is able to get, the one for a miss, and the other for a on-up, with the absorber: and the dimmer-server make an out-of-town-ment for him that is to be bright-climaxingsed before-turns yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah.this is the teaching of him in whom is the touch of vexing-speckled-waspishness, whose hand is not able to get that which pertaineth to his bright-climaxingsing.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah spake unto mose-extracted and unto aaron-cabinet, saying,when ye be come into the land of canaan-mobile-trade, which i give to you for a possession, and i put the touch of vexing-speckled-waspishness in a daughter-house of the land of your possession;and he that owneth the daughter-house come and tell the dimmer-server, saying, it seemeth to me there is as it were a touch in the daughter-house:then the dimmer-server order-prescribe that they empty the daughter-house, before-turns the dimmer-server go into it to see the touch, that all that is in the daughter-house be not made stained-ceased: and afterward the dimmer-server go in to see the daughter-house:and he look on the touch, and, behold, if the touch be in the walls of the daughter-house with hollow streaks, greenish or earthy-man-reddish, which in sight are lower than the wall;then the dimmer-server go out of the daughter-house to the opening of the daughter-house, and shut up the daughter-house seven days:and the dimmer-server come again the seventh day, and look: and, behold, if the touch be spread in the walls of the daughter-house;then the dimmer-server order-prescribe that they take away the stones in which the touch is, and they cast them into an stained-ceased place without the light-city:and he cause the daughter-house to be scraped within round about, and they pour out the dust that they scrape off without the light-city into an stained-ceased place:and they take other stones, and put them in the place of those stones; and he take other mortar, and plaster the daughter-house.and if the touch come again, and break out in the daughter-house, after that he hath taken away the stones, and after he hath scraped the daughter-house, and after it is plastered;then the dimmer-server come and look, and, behold, if the touch be spread in the daughter-house, it is a fretting vexing-speckled-waspishness in the daughter-house; it is stained-ceased.and he break down the daughter-house, the stones of it, and the timber thereof, and all the mortar of the daughter-house; and he carry them forth out of the light-city into an stained-ceased place.moreover he that goeth into the daughter-house all the while that it is shut up be stained-ceased until the even.and he that lieth in the daughter-house wash his clothes; and he that eateth in the daughter-house wash his clothes.and if the dimmer-server come in, and look upon it, and, behold, the touch hath not spread in the daughter-house, after the daughter-house was plastered: then the dimmer-server pronounce the daughter-house bright-climaxing, because the touch is healed.and he take to bright-climaxingse the daughter-house two birds, and cedar wood, and two caterpillars, and hyssop-discharging:and he kill the one of the birds in an earthen tool over running from-waters:and he take the cedar wood, and the hyssop-discharging, and the two caterpillars, and the living bird, and dip them in the blood of the slain bird, and in the running from-waters, and sprinkle the daughter-house seven times:and he bright-climaxingse the daughter-house with the blood of the bird, and with the running from-waters, and with the living bird, and with the cedar wood, and with the hyssop-discharging, and with the two caterpillars:and he send the living bird out of the light-city into the open fields, and make an out-of-town-ment for the daughter-house: and it be bright-climaxing.this is the teaching for all manner of touch of vexing-speckled-waspishness, and scall,and for the vexing-speckled-waspishness of a garment, and of a daughter-house,and for a rising, and for a scab, and for a bright spot:to teach when it is stained-ceased, and when it is bright-climaxing: this is the teaching of vexing-speckled-waspishness.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah spake unto mose-extracted and to aaron-cabinet, saying,speak unto children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards, and say unto them, when any man hath a running issue out of his flesh, because of his issue he is stained-ceased.and this be his stained-ceasedness in his issue: whether his flesh run with his issue, or his flesh be stopped from his issue, it is his stained-ceasedness.every bed, whereon he lieth that hath the issue, is stained-ceased: and every thing, whereon he sitteth, be stained-ceased.and whosoever toucheth his bed wash his clothes, and bathe himself in from-waters, and be stained-ceased until the even.and he that sitteth on any thing whereon he sat that hath the issue wash his clothes, and bathe himself in from-waters, and be stained-ceased until the even.and he that toucheth the flesh of him that hath the issue wash his clothes, and bathe himself in from-waters, and be stained-ceased until the even.and if he that hath the issue spit upon him that is bright-climaxing; then he wash his clothes, and bathe himself in from-waters, and be stained-ceased until the even.and what saddle soever he rideth upon that hath the issue be stained-ceased.and whosoever toucheth any thing that was under him be stained-ceased until the even: and he that beareth any of those things wash his clothes, and bathe himself in from-waters, and be stained-ceased until the even.and whomsoever he toucheth that hath the issue, and hath not rinsed his hands in from-waters, he wash his clothes, and bathe himself in from-waters, and be stained-ceased until the even.and the tool of earth, that he toucheth which hath the issue, be broken: and every tool of wood be rinsed in from-waters.and when he that hath an issue is bright-climaxingsed of his issue; then he number to himself seven days for his bright-climaxingsing, and wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in running from-waters, and be bright-climaxing.and on the eighth day he take to him two rises, or two child-betweens of pigeons, and come before-turns yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah unto the opening of the tent of until-conception, and give them unto the dimmer-server:and the dimmer-server inward them, the one for a miss, and the other for a on-up; and the dimmer-server make an out-of-town-ment for him before-turns yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah for his issue.and if any man's seed of copulation go out from him, then he wash all his flesh in from-waters, and be stained-ceased until the even.and every garment, and every light-skin, whereon is the seed of copulation, be washed with from-waters, and be stained-ceased until the even.the woman also with whom man lie with seed of copulation, they both bathe themselves in from-waters, and be stained-ceased until the even.and if a woman have an issue, and her issue in her flesh be blood, she be put apart seven days: and whosoever toucheth her be stained-ceased until the even.and every thing that she lieth upon in her separation be stained-ceased: every thing also that she sitteth upon be stained-ceased.and whosoever toucheth her bed wash his clothes, and bathe himself in from-waters, and be stained-ceased until the even.and whosoever toucheth any thing that she sat upon wash his clothes, and bathe himself in from-waters, and be stained-ceased until the even.and if it be on her bed, or on any thing whereon she sitteth, when he toucheth it, he be stained-ceased until the even.and if any man lie with her at all, and her flowers be upon him, he be stained-ceased seven days; and all the bed whereon he lieth be stained-ceased.and if a woman have an issue of her blood many days out of the time of her separation, or if it run beyond the time of her separation; all the days of the issue of her stained-ceasedness be as the days of her separation: she be stained-ceased.every bed whereon she lieth all the days of her issue be unto her as the bed of her separation: and whatsoever she sitteth upon be stained-ceased, as the stained-ceasedness of her separation.and whosoever toucheth those things be stained-ceased, and wash his clothes, and bathe himself in from-waters, and be stained-ceased until the even.and if she be bright-climaxingsed of her issue, then she number to herself seven days, and after that she be bright-climaxing.and on the eighth day she take unto her two turtles, or two child-betweens of pigeons, and bring them unto the dimmer-server, to the opening of the tent of until-conception.and the dimmer-server inward the one for a miss, and the other for a on-up; and the dimmer-server make an out-of-town-ment for her before-turns yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah for the issue of her stained-ceasedness.thus ye separate children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards from their stained-ceasedness; that they die not in their stained-ceasedness, when they cease my dwelling that is among them.this is the teaching of him that hath an issue, and of him whose seed goeth from him, and is ceased therewith;and of her that is sick of her flowers, and of him that hath an issue, of the man, and of the woman, and of him that lieth with her that is stained-ceased.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah spake unto mose-extracted after the death of the two children-betweens of aaron-cabinet, when they inwarded before-turns yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, and died;and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah said unto mose-extracted, speak unto aaron-cabinet thy brother, that he come not at all times into the dedicated-finished place within the breaker before-turns the out-of-townment, which is upon the cabinet; that he die not: for i will appear in the cloud upon the out-of-townment.thus aaron-cabinet come into the dedicated-finished place: with a bull child-between of visit-cattle for a miss, and a ram-voiceless for a on-up.he put on the dedicated-finished linen you-wrote-coat, and he have the linen trousers upon his flesh, and be girded with a linen girdle, and with the linen branch-bonnet he be attired: these are dedicated-finished garments; therefore he wash his flesh in from-waters, and so put them on.and he take of the until-witness of children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards two kids of the intense-goats for a miss, and one ram-voiceless for a on-up.and aaron-cabinet inward his bull of the miss, which is for himself, and make an out-of-town-ment for himself, and for his daughter-house.and he take the two intense-goats, and present them before-turns yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah at the opening of the tent of until-conception.and aaron-cabinet cast lot-covers upon the two intense-goats; one lot-cover for yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, and the other lot-cover for the azazel-out-outof.and aaron-cabinet bring the intense-goat upon which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah's lot-cover fell, and inward him for a miss.and the intense-goat, on which the lot-cover fell to be the azazel-out-outof, be presented alive before-turns yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, to make an out-of-town-ment with him, and to let him go for a azazel-out-outof into the place-of-word-desert.and aaron-cabinet bring the bull of the miss, which is for himself, and make an out-of-town-ment for himself, and for his daughter-house, and kill the bull of the miss which is for himself:and he take a censer full of burning coals of fire from off the butcher-kitchen before-turns yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, and his hands full of smoke drug beaten small, and bring it within the breaker:and he put the incense upon the fire before-turns yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, that the cloud of the incense may cover the out-of-townment that is upon the until-witness, that he die not:and he take of the blood of the bull, and sprinkle it with his finger upon the out-of-townment eastward; and before-turns the out-of-townment he sprinkle of the blood with his finger seven times.then he kill the intense-goat of the miss, that is for the with-mum-people, and bring his blood within the breaker, and do with that blood as he did with the blood of the bull, and sprinkle it upon the out-of-townment, and before-turns the out-of-townment:and he make an out-of-town-ment for the dedicated-finished place, because of the stained-ceasedness of children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards, and because of their crimes in all their misses: and so he do for the tent of until-conception, that remaineth among them in the midst of their stained-ceasedness.and there be no man in the tent of until-conception when he goeth in to make an out-of-town-ment in the dedicated-finished place, until he come out, and have made an out-of-town-ment for himself, and for his daughter-household, and for all the until-witness of israel-saturated-towards.and he go out unto the butcher-kitchen that is before-turns yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, and make an out-of-town-ment for it; and take of the blood of the bull, and of the blood of the intense-goat, and put it upon the horn-rays of the butcher-kitchen round about.and he sprinkle of the blood upon it with his finger seven times, and bright-climaxingse it, and dedicate-finify it from the stained-ceasedness of children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards.and when he hath made an end of out-of-towning the dedicated-finished place, and the tent of until-conception, and the butcher-kitchen, he inward the live intense-goat:and aaron-cabinet lay both his hands upon the head of the live intense-goat, and confess over him all the seasons of children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards, and all their crimes in all their misses, putting them upon the head of the intense-goat, and send him away by the hand of a fit man into the place-of-word-desert:and the intense-goat bear upon him all their seasons unto cut-off land: and he send the intense-goat in the place-of-word-desert.and aaron-cabinet come into the tent of until-conception, and put off the linen garments, which he put on when he went into the dedicated-finished place, and leave them there:and he wash his flesh with from-waters in the dedicated-finished place, and put on his garments, and come forth, and inward his on-up, and the on-up of the with-mum-people, and make an out-of-town-ment for himself, and for the with-mum-people.and the fat of the miss he burn upon the butcher-kitchen.and he that send the intense-goat for the azazel-out-outof wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in from-waters, and afterward come into the camp.and the bull for the miss, and the intense-goat for the miss, whose blood was brought in to make out-of-town-ment in the dedicated-finished place, one carry forth without the camp; and they burn in the fire their light-skins, and their flesh, and their dung.and he that burneth them wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in from-waters, and afterward he come into the camp.and this be a statute for ever unto you: that in the seventh month, on the tenth day of the month, ye pauper your beings, and do no work at all, whether it be one of your own country, or a stranger that sojourneth among you:for on that day the dimmer-server make an out-of-town-ment for you, to bright-climaxingse you, that ye may be bright-climaxing from all your misses before-turns yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah.it be a sabbath-seven of rest unto you, and ye pauper your beings, by a statute for ever.and the dimmer-server, whom he lube, and whom he fill to dimmer-server in his father's stead, make the out-of-town-ment, and put on the linen clothes, even the dedicated-finished garments:and he make an out-of-town-ment for the dedicated-finished dedicated, and he make an out-of-town-ment for the tent of until-conception, and for the butcher-kitchen, and he make an out-of-town-ment for the dimmer-servers, and for all the with-mum-people of the until-witness.and this be an everlasting statute unto you, to make an out-of-town-ment for children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards for all their misses once a year. and he did as yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah order-prescribed mose-extracted.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah spake unto mose-extracted, saying,speak unto aaron-cabinet, and unto his children-betweens, and unto all children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards, and say unto them; this is the thing which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah hath order-prescribed, saying,what man soever there be of the daughter-house of israel-saturated-towards, that killeth an wall-ox, or lamb, or intense-goat, in the camp, or that killeth it out of the camp,and bringeth it not unto the opening of the tent of until-conception, to inward an inward unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah before-turns the dwelling of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah; blood be imputed unto that man; he hath shed blood; and that man be cut off from his with-mum-people:to the end that children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards may bring their butchers, which they inward in the open field, even that they may bring them unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, unto the opening of the tent of until-conception, unto the dimmer-server, and inward them for wholes unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah.and the dimmer-server sprinkle the blood upon the butcher-kitchen of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah at the opening of the tent of until-conception, and burn the fat for a smell fragrance unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah.and they no more inward their butchers unto devils, after whom they have gone a whoring. this be a statute for ever unto them throughout their generations.and thou say unto them, whatsoever man there be of the daughter-house of israel-saturated-towards, or of the strangers which sojourn among you, that inwardeth a on-up or butcher,and bringeth it not unto the opening of the tent of until-conception, to inward it unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah; even that man be cut off from his with-mum-people.and whatsoever man there be of the daughter-house of israel-saturated-towards, or of the strangers that sojourn among you, that eateth any manner of blood; i will even set my face-turns against that being that eateth blood, and will cut him off from inward his with-mum-people.for the life of the flesh is in the blood: and i have given it to you upon the butcher-kitchen to make an out-of-town-ment for your beings: for it is the blood that maketh an out-of-town-ment for the being.therefore i said unto children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards, no being of you eat blood, neither any stranger that sojourneth among you eat blood.and whatsoever man there be of children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards, or of the strangers that sojourn among you, which hunteth and catcheth any beast or fowl that may be eaten; he even pour out the blood thereof, and cover it with dust.for it is the life of all flesh; the blood of it is for the life thereof: therefore i said unto children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards, ye eat the blood of no manner of flesh: for the life of all flesh is the blood thereof: whosoever eateth it be cut off.and every being that eateth that which died of itself, or that which was torn with beasts, whether it be one of your own country, or a stranger, he both wash his clothes, and bathe himself in from-waters, and be stained-ceased until the even: then he be bright-climaxing.and if he wash them not, nor bathe his flesh; then he bear his torment.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah spake unto mose-extracted, saying,speak unto children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards, and say unto them, i am yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah your elohim-towards-these.after the doings of the land of mizraim-narrows, wherein ye dwelt, ye not do: and after the doings of the land of canaan-mobile-trade, whither i bring you, ye not do: neither ye walk in their ordinances.ye do my decision-grammars, and keep mine ordinances, to walk therein: i am yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah your elohim-towards-these.ye therefore keep my statutes, and my decision-grammars: which if a man do, he live in them: i am yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah.none of you approach to any that is near of kin to him, to uncover their nakedness: i am yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah.the nakedness of thy father, or the nakedness of thy mother, thou not uncover: she is thy mother; no uncover her nakedness.the nakedness of thy father's woman thou not uncover: it is thy father's nakedness.the nakedness of thy sister, the daughter-hoof-bat-child of thy father, or daughter-hoof-bat-child of thy mother, whether she be born at home, or born abroad, even their nakedness no uncover.the nakedness of thy child-between's daughter-hoof-bat-child, or of thy daughter-hoof-bat-child's daughter-hoof-bat-child, even their nakedness no uncover: for theirs is thine own nakedness.the nakedness of thy father's woman's daughter-hoof-bat-child, begotten of thy father, she is thy sister, no uncover her nakedness.no uncover the nakedness of thy father's sister: she is thy father's near kinswoman.no uncover the nakedness of thy mother's sister: for she is thy mother's near kinswoman.no uncover the nakedness of thy father's brother, no approach to his woman: she is thine aunt.no uncover the nakedness of thy daughter-hoof-bat-child in teaching: she is thy child-between's woman; no uncover her nakedness.no uncover the nakedness of thy brother's woman: it is thy brother's nakedness.no uncover the nakedness of a woman and her daughter-hoof-bat-child, neither thou take her child-between's daughter-hoof-bat-child, or her daughter-hoof-bat-child's daughter-hoof-bat-child, to uncover her nakedness; for they are her near kinswomen: it is wickedness.neither thou take a woman to her sister, to vex her, to uncover her nakedness, beside the other in her life time.also no approach unto a woman to uncover her nakedness, as long as she is put apart for her stained-ceasedness.moreover no lie carnally with thy neighbor's woman, to cease thyself with her.and no let any of thy seed pass through the fire to molech-moloch-king, neither thou profane the name of thy elohim-towards-these: i am yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah.no lie with mankind, as with womankind: it is abomination.neither thou lie with any beast to cease thyself therewith: neither any woman stand before-turns a beast to lie down thereto: it is confusion.cease not ye yourselves in any of these things: for in all these the nations are ceased which i cast out before-turns you:and the land is ceased: therefore i do visit the torment thereof upon it, and the land itself vomiteth out her inhabitants.ye therefore keep my statutes and my decision-grammars, and not commit any of these abominations; neither any of your own nation, nor any stranger that sojourneth among you:(for all these abominations have the men of the land done, which were before-turns you, and the land is ceased;)that the land spue not you out also, when ye cease it, as it spued out the nations that were before-turns you.for whosoever commit any of these abominations, even the beings that commit them be cut off from inward their with-mum-people.therefore ye keep mine ordinance, that ye commit not any one of these abominable customs, which were committed before-turns you, and that ye cease not yourselves therein: i am yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah your elohim-towards-these.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah spake unto mose-extracted, saying,speak unto all the until-witness of children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards, and say unto them, ye be dedicated-finished: for i yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah your elohim-towards-these am dedicated-finished.ye fear every man his mother, and his father, and keep my sabbath-sevens: i am yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah your elohim-towards-these.turn ye not unto idols, nor make to yourselves molten elohim-towards-these: i am yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah your elohim-towards-these.and if ye inward a butcher of wholes unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, ye inward it at your own will.it be eaten the same day ye inward it, and on the morrow: and if ought remain until the third day, it be burnt in the fire.and if it be eaten at all on the third day, it is abominable; it not be accepted.therefore every one that eateth it bear his torment, because he hath profaned the dedicateed thing of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah: and that being be cut off from his with-mum-people.and when ye reap the harvest of your land, no wholly reap the corners of thy field, neither thou gather the gleanings of thy harvest.and no glean thy vineyard, neither thou gather every grape of thy vineyard; thou leave them for the poor and stranger: i am yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah your elohim-towards-these.ye not steal, neither deal falsely, neither lie one to another.and ye not swear by my name falsely, neither thou profane the name of thy elohim-towards-these: i am yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah.no defraud thy neighbor, neither rob him: the wages of him that is hired not abide with thee all night until the morning.no curse the deaf, nor put a stumbling-block before-turns the blind, and fear thy elohim-towards-these: i am yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah.ye do no not being right in decision-grammar: no respect the person of the poor, nor honor the person of the mighty: and in being right thou decide thy neighbor.no go up and down as a talebearer among thy with-mum-people: neither thou stand against the blood of thy neighbor; i am yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah.no hate thy brother in thine heart: thou in any wise rebuke thy neighbor, and not suffer miss upon him.no avenge, nor bear any grudge against children-betweens of thy with-mum-people, and thou love thy neighbor as thyself: i am yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah.ye keep my statutes. no let thy in-them-animal gender with a diverse kind: no sow thy field with mingled seed: neither a garment mingled of linen and woolen come upon thee.and whosoever lieth carnally with a woman, that is a bondmaid, betrothed to an man, and not at all redeemed, nor freedom given her; she be scourged; they not be put to death, because she was not free.and he inward his fire-name unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, unto the opening of the tent of until-conception, even a ram-voiceless for a fire-name.and the dimmer-server make an out-of-town-ment for him with the ram-voiceless of the fire-name before-turns yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah for his miss which he hath done: and the miss which he hath done be released him.and when ye come into the land, and have planted all manner of trees for food, then ye count the fruit thereof as foreskinned: three years it be as foreskinned unto you: it not be eaten of.and in the fourth year all the fruit thereof be dedicated-finished to praise yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah withal.and in the fifth year ye eat of the fruit thereof, that it may yield unto you the increase thereof: i am yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah your elohim-towards-these.ye not eat any thing with the blood: neither ye use enchantment, nor guard-observe times.ye not round the corners of your heads, neither thou mar the corners of thy beard.ye not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead, nor print any marks upon you: i am yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah.do not prostitute thy daughter-hoof-bat-child, to cause her to be a whore; lest the land fall to whoredom, and the land become full of wickedness.ye keep my sabbath-sevens, and reverence my dedicated-finished: i am yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah.regard not them that have familiar breath-spirits, neither seek after wizards, to be ceased by them: i am yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah your elohim-towards-these.thou rise up before-turns the hoary head, and honor the face-turns of the old man, and fear thy elohim-towards-these: i am yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah.and if a stranger sojourn with thee in your land, ye not vex him.and the stranger that dwelleth with you be unto you as one born among you, and thou love him as thyself; for ye were strangers in the land of mizraim-narrows: i am yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah your elohim-towards-these.ye do no not being right in decision-grammar, in meteyard, in weight, or in measure.just balances, just weights, a just ephah-tired, and a just here-hin, ye have: i am yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah your elohim-towards-these, which brought you out of the land of mizraim-narrows.therefore ye guard-observe all my statutes, and all my decision-grammars, and do them: i am yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah spake unto mose-extracted, saying,again, thou say to children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards, whosoever he be of children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards, or of the strangers that sojourn in israel-saturated-towards, that giveth any of his seed unto molech-moloch-king; he surely be put to death: the with-mum-people of the land father-child-stone him with stones.and i will set my face-turns against that man, and will cut him off from inward his with-mum-people; because he hath given of his seed unto molech-moloch-king, to cease my dedicated-finished, and to profane my dedicated-finished name.and if the with-mum-people of the land do any ways hide their eyes from the man, when he giveth of his seed unto molech-moloch-king, and kill him not:then i will set my face-turns against that man, and against his family, and will cut him off, and all that go a whoring after him, to prostitute with molech-moloch-king, from inward their with-mum-people.and the being that turneth after such as have familiar breath-spirits, and after wizards, to go a whoring after them, i will even set my face-turns against that being, and will cut him off from inward his with-mum-people.dedicate-finify yourselves therefore, and be ye dedicated-finished: for i am yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah your elohim-towards-these.and ye keep my statutes, and do them: i am yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah which dedicate-finify you.for every one that curseth his father or his mother be deadly put to death: he hath cursed his father or his mother; his blood be upon him.and the man that committeth adultery with another man's woman, even he that committeth adultery with his neighbor's woman, the adulterer and the adulteress surely be put to death.and the man that lieth with his father's woman hath uncovered his father's nakedness: both of them surely be put to death; their blood be upon them.and if a man lie with his daughter-hoof-bat-child in teaching, both of them surely be put to death: they have wrought confusion; their blood be upon them.if a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination: they surely be put to death; their blood be upon them.and if a man take a woman and her mother, it is wickedness: they be burnt with fire, both he and they; that there be no wickedness among you.and if a man lie with a beast, he surely be put to death: and ye slay the beast.and if a woman approach unto any beast, and lie down thereto, thou kill the woman, and the beast: they surely be put to death; their blood be upon them.and if a man take his sister, his father's daughter-hoof-bat-child, or his mother's daughter-hoof-bat-child, and see her nakedness, and she see his nakedness; it is a wicked thing; and they be cut off in the sight of their with-mum-people: he hath uncovered his sister's nakedness; he bear his torment.and if a man lie with a woman having her sickness, and uncover her nakedness; he hath discovered her fountain, and she hath uncovered the fountain of her blood: and both of them be cut off from inward their with-mum-people.and no uncover the nakedness of thy mother's sister, nor of thy father's sister: for he uncovereth his near kin: they bear their torment.and if a man lie with his uncle's woman, he hath uncovered his uncle's nakedness: they bear their miss; they die childless.and if a man take his brother's woman, it is an stained-ceased thing: he hath uncovered his brother's nakedness; they be childless.ye therefore keep all my statutes, and all my decision-grammars, and do them: that the land, whither i bring you to dwell therein, spue you not out.and ye not walk in the manners of the nation, which i cast out before-turns you: for they committed all these things, and therefore i crave-abhorred them.and i have said unto you, ye inherit their land, and i will give it unto you to possess it, a land that floweth with milk and honey: i am yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah your elohim-towards-these, which have separated you from other with-mum-people.ye therefore put difference between-bin bright-climaxing beasts and stained-ceased, and between-bin stained-ceased fowls and bright-climaxing: and ye not make your beings abominable by beast, or by fowl, or by any manner of living thing that creepeth on the ground, which i have separated from you as stained-ceased.and ye be dedicated-finished unto me: for i yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah am dedicated-finished, and have severed you from other with-mum-people, that ye should be mine.a man also or woman that hath a familiar breath-spirit, or that is a wizard, surely be put to death: they father-child-stone them with stones: their blood be upon them.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah said unto mose-extracted, speak unto the dimmer-servers children-betweens of aaron-cabinet, and say unto them, there none be ceased for the dead among his with-mum-people:and for his kin, that is near unto him, that is, for his mother, and for his father, and for his child-between, and for his daughter-hoof-bat-child, and for his brother.and for his sister a virgin, that is nigh unto him, which hath had no man; for her may he be ceased.and he not cease himself, being a chief man among his

everlasting covenant.and it be aaron-cabinet's and his children-betweens'; and they eat it in the dedicated-finished place: for it is most dedicated-finished unto him of the inwards of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah made by fire by a perpetual statute.and child-between of an israel-saturated-towardsitish woman, whose father was an mizraim-narrowsian, went out among children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards: and this child-between of the israel-saturated-towardsitish woman and a man of israel-saturated-towards strove together in the camp;and the israel-saturated-towardsitish woman's child-between blasphemed the name of the base-lord, and cursed. and they brought him unto mose-extracted: (and his mother's name was shelomi-my-peaceth, the daughter-hoof-bat-child of dibri,

as he hath caused a blemish in a man, so it be done to him again.and he that killeth a beast, he restore it: and he that killeth a man, he be put to death.ye have one manner of teaching, as well for the stranger, as for one of your own country: for i am yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah your elohim-towards-these.and mose-extracted spake to children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards, that they should bring forth him that had cursed out of the camp, and father-child-stone him with stones. and children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards did as yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah order-prescribed mose-extracted.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah spake unto mose-extracted in mount )sinai-bush-(proto, saying,speak unto children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards, and say unto them, when ye come into the land which i give you, then the land keep a sabbath-seven unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah.six years thou sow thy field, and six years thou prune thy vineyard, and gather in the fruit thereof;and in the seventh year be a sabbath-seven of rest unto the land, a sabbath-seven for yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah: thou neither sow thy field, nor prune thy vineyard.that which groweth of its own accord of thy harvest no reap, neither gather the grapes of thy vine undressed: for it is a year of rest unto the land.and the sabbath-seven of the land be meat for you; for thee, and for thy worker, and for thy maid, and for thy hired worker, and for thy stranger that sojourneth with thee.and for thy in-them-animal, and for the beast that are in thy land, all the increase thereof be meat.and thou number seven sabbath-sevens of years unto thee, seven times seven years; and the space of the seven sabbath-sevens of years be unto thee forty and nine years.then thou cause the mouthpiece-trumpet of the river-jubilee to sound on the tenth day of the seventh month, in the day of out-of-town-ment ye make the mouthpiece-trumpet sound throughout all your land.and ye dedicate-finify the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof: it be a river-jubilee unto you; and ye return every man unto his possession, and ye return every man unto his family.a river-jubilee that fiftieth year be unto you: ye not sow, neither reap that which groweth of itself in it, nor gather the grapes in it of thy vine undressed.for it is the river-jubilee; it be dedicated-finished unto you: ye eat the increase thereof out of the field.in the year of this river-jubilee ye return every man unto his possession.and if thou sell ought unto thy neighbor, or buyest ought of thy neighbor's hand, ye not oppress one another:according to the number of years after the river-jubilee thou buy of thy neighbor, and according unto the number of years of the fruits he sell unto thee:according to the multitude of years thou increase the price thereof, and according to the fewness of years thou diminish the price of it: for according to the number of the years of the fruits doth he sell unto thee.ye not therefore oppress one another; and thou fear thy elohim-towards-these: for i am yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah your elohim-towards-these.wherefore ye do my statutes, and keep my decision-grammars, and do them; and ye dwell in the land in safety.and the land yield her fruit, and ye eat your fill, and dwell therein in safety.and if ye say, what we eat the seventh year? behold, we not sow, nor gather in our increase:then i will order-prescribe my knee-fluffy-blessing upon you in the sixth year, and it bring forth fruit for three years.and ye sow the eighth year, and eat yet of old fruit until the ninth year; until her fruits come in ye eat of the old store.the land not be sold for ever: for the land is mine, for ye are strangers and sojourners with me.and in all the land of your possession ye grant a redemption for the land.if thy brother be waxen poor, and hath sold away some of his possession, and if any of his kin come to redeem it, then he redeem that which his brother sold.and if the man have none to redeem it, and himself be able to redeem it;then let him count the years of the sale thereof, and restore the overplus unto the man to whom he sold it; that he may return unto his possession.and if he be not able to restore it to him, then that which is sold remain in the hand of him that hath bought it until the year of river-jubilee: and in the river-jubilee it go out, and he return unto his possession.and if a man sell a dwelling daughter-house in a walled light-city, then he may redeem it within a whole year after it is sold; within a full year may he redeem it.and if it be not redeemed within the space of a full year, then the daughter-house that is in the walled light-city be established for ever to him that bought it throughout his generations: it not go out in the river-jubilee.and the daughter-houses of the villages which have no wall round about them be counted as the fields of the country: they may be redeemed, and they go out in the river-jubilee.notwithstanding the cities of the levi-jointes, and the daughter-houses of the cities of their possession, may the levi-jointes redeem at any time.and if a man purchase of the levi-jointes, then the daughter-house that was sold, and the light-city of his possession, go out in the year of river-jubilee: for the daughter-houses of the cities of the levi-jointes are their possession among children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards.and the field of the plots of their cities may not be sold; for it is their perpetual possession.and if thy brother be waxen poor, and fallen in decay with thee; then thou relieve him: yea, though he be a stranger, or a sojourner; that he may live with thee.take thou no usury of him, or increase: and fear thy elohim-towards-these; that thy brother may live with thee.no give him thy money upon usury, nor lend him thy victuals for increase.i am yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah your elohim-towards-these, which brought you forth out of the land of mizraim-narrows, to give you the land of canaan-mobile-trade, and to be your elohim-towards-these.and if thy brother that dwelleth by thee be waxen poor, and be sold unto thee; no compel him to work for as a bondservant:and as an hired worker, and as a sojourner, he be with thee, and work for thee unto the year of river-jubilee.and then he depart from thee, both he and his children-betweens with him, and return unto his own family, and unto the possession of his fathers he return.for they are my workers, which i brought forth out of the land of mizraim-narrows: they not be sold as workers.no rule over him with rigor; and fear thy elohim-towards-these.both thy workers, and thy bondmaids, which thou have, be of the nations that are round about you; of them ye buy workers and bondmaids.moreover of children-betweens of the strangers that do sojourn among you, of them ye buy, and of their families that are with you, which they begat in your land: and they be your possession.and ye take them as an inheritance for your children-betweens after you, to inherit them for a possession; they be your workers for ever: and over your brethren children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards, ye not rule one over another with rigor.and if a sojourner or stranger wax rich by thee, and thy brother that dwelleth by him wax poor, and sell himself unto the stranger or sojourner by thee, or to the stock of the stranger's family:after that he is sold he may be redeemed again; one of his brethren may redeem him:either his uncle, or his uncle's child-between, may redeem him, or any that is nigh of kin unto him of his family may redeem him; or if he be able, he may redeem himself.and he reckon with him that bought him from the year that he was sold to him unto the year of river-jubilee: and the price of his sale be according unto the number of years, according to the time of an hired worker it be with him.if there be yet many years behind, according unto them he give again the price of his redemption out of the money that he was bought for.and if there remain and few years unto the year of river-jubilee, then he count with him, and according unto his years he give him again the price of his redemption.and as a yearly hired worker he be with him: and the other not rule with rigor over him in thy sight.and if he be not redeemed in these years, then he go out in the year of river-jubilee, both he, and his children-betweens with him.for unto me children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards are workers; they are my workers whom i brought forth out of the land of mizraim-narrows: i am yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah your elohim-towards-these.ye make you no idols nor graven image, neither rear you up a standing image, neither ye set up any image of father-child-stone in your land, to partake in it: for i am yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah your elohim-towards-these.ye keep my sabbath-sevens, and reverence my dedicated-finished: i am yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah.if ye walk in my statutes, and keep my order-prescriptions, and do them;then i will give you rain in due season, and the land yield her increase, and the trees of the field yield their fruit.and your threshing reach unto the vintage, and the vintage reach unto the sowing time: and ye eat your bread to the full, and dwell in your land safely.and i will give peace in the land, and ye lie down, and none make you afraid: and i will rid bad beasts out of the land, neither the sword go through your land.and ye chase your father-adversaries, and they fall before-turns you by the sword.and five of you chase an hundred, and an hundred of you put ten thousand to flight: and your father-adversaries fall before-turns you by the sword.for i will have respect unto you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you, and establish my covenant with you.and ye eat old store, and bring forth the old because of the new.and i set my dwelling among you: and my being not crave-abhor you.and i will walk among you, and will be your elohim-towards-these, and ye be my with-mum-people.i am yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah your elohim-towards-these, which brought you forth out of the land of mizraim-narrows, that ye should not be their workers; and i have broken the bands of your yoke, and made you go upright.and if ye will not hearken unto me, and will not do all these order-prescriptions;and if ye despise my statutes, or if your being crave-abhor my decision-grammars, so that ye will not do all my order-prescriptions, and that ye break my covenant:i also will do this unto you; i will even appoint over you terror, consumption, and the burning ague, that consume the eyes, and cause sorrow of heart: and ye sow your seed in vain, for your father-adversaries eat it.and i will set my face-turns against you, and ye be slain before-turns your father-adversaries: they that hate you reign over you; and ye flee when none pursueth you.and if ye will not yet for all this hearken unto me, then i will punish you seven times more for your misses.and i will break the pride of your dynamic; and i will make your namespaces as iron, and your earth as brass:and your strength be spent in vain: for your land not yield her increase, neither the trees of the land yield their fruits.and if ye walk contrary unto me, and will not hearken unto me; i will bring seven times more plagues upon you according to your misses.i will also send wild beasts among you, which rob you of your children-betweens, and destroy your in-them-animal, and make you few in number; and your high ways be desolate.and if ye will not be reformed by me by these things, and will walk contrary unto me;then will i also walk contrary unto you, and will punish you yet seven times for your misses.and i will bring a sword upon you, that avenge the quarrel of my covenant: and when ye are added together within your cities, i will send the pestilence among you; and ye be delivered into the hand of the enemy.and when i have broken the staff of your bread, ten women bake your bread in one oven, and they deliver you your bread again by weight: and ye eat, and not be satisfied.and if ye will not for all this hearken unto me, and walk contrary unto me;then i will walk contrary unto you also in fury; and i, even i, will chastise you seven times for your misses.and ye eat the flesh of your children-betweens, and the flesh of your children-betweenesss ye eat.and i will destroy your high places, and cut down your images, and cast your carcasses upon the carcasses of your idols, and my being crave-abhor you.and i will make your cities waste, and bring your finishes unto desolation, and i will not smell the savor of your sweet odors.and i will bring the land into desolation: and your father-adversaries which dwell therein be astonished at it.and i will scatter you among the nations, and will draw out a sword after you: and your land be desolate, and your cities waste.then the land enjoy her sabbath-sevens, as long as it lieth desolate, and ye be in your father-adversaries' land; even then the land rest, and enjoy her sabbath-sevens.as long as it lieth desolate it rest; because it did not rest in your sabbath-sevens, when ye dwelt upon it.and upon them that are left alive of you i will send a faintness into their hearts in the lands of their father-adversaries; and the sound of a shaken leaf chase them; and they flee, as fleeing from a sword; and they fall when none pursueth.and they fall one upon another, as it were before-turns a sword, when none pursueth: and ye have no dynamic to stand before-turns your father-adversaries.and ye perish among the nations, and the land of your father-adversaries eat you up.and they that are left of you pine away in their torment in your father-adversaries' lands; and also in the seasons of their fathers they pine away with them.if they confess their torment, and the torment of their fathers, with their fire-name which they fire-nameed against me, and that also they have walked contrary unto me;and that i also have walked contrary unto them, and have brought them into the land of their father-adversaries; if then their foreskinned hearts be humbled, and they then accept of the punishment of their torment:then will i remember my covenant with jacob-backstreet, and also my covenant with isaac-laughter, and also my covenant with abraham-their-dick will i remember; and i will remember the land.the land also be left of them, and enjoy her sabbath-sevens, while she lieth desolate without them: and they accept of the punishment of their torment: because, even because they despised my decision-grammars, and because their being crave-abhorred my statutes.and yet for all that, when they be in the land of their father-adversaries, i will not cast them away, neither will i crave-abhor them, to destroy them utterly, and to break my covenant with them: for i am yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah their elohim-towards-these.and i will for their sakes remember the covenant of their ancestors, whom i brought forth out of the land of mizraim-narrows in the sight of the nations, that i might be their elohim-towards-these: i am yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah.these are the statutes and decision-grammars and teachings, which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah made between-bin him and children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards in mount

yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah order-prescribed mose-extracted.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah spake unto mose-extracted, saying,order-prescribe children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards, that they put out of the camp every speckled-waspish, and every one that hath an issue, and whosoever is ceased by the dead:both rememberer and pierced ye put out, without the camp ye put them; that they cease not their camps, in the midst whereof i dwell.and children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards did so, and put them out without the camp: as yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah spake unto mose-extracted, so did children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah spake unto mose-extracted, saying,speak unto children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards, when a man or woman commit any miss that men commit, to do a fire-name to yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, and that person be fire-name;then they confess their miss which they have done: and he recompense his fire-name with the principal thereof, and add unto it the fifth part thereof, and give it unto him against whom he hath fire-nameed.and if the man have no kinsman to recompense the fire-name unto, let the fire-name be recompensed unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, even to the dimmer-server; beside the ram-voiceless of the out-of-town-ment, whereby an out-of-town-ment be made for him.and every inward of all the dedicated-finished things of children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards, which they bring unto the dimmer-server, be his.and every man's dedicateed things be his: whatsoever any man giveth the dimmer-server, it be his.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah spake unto mose-extracted, saying,speak unto children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards, and say unto them, if any man's woman go aside, and commit a trespass against him,and a man lie with her carnally, and it be hid from the eyes of her man, and be kept close, and she be ceased, and there be no witness against her, neither she be taken with the manner;and breath-spirit of jealousy come upon him, and he be jealous of his woman, and she be ceased: or if breath-spirit of jealousy come upon him, and he be jealous of his woman, and she be not ceased:then the man bring his woman unto the dimmer-server, and he inward her inward for her, the tenth part of an ephah-tired of gates-barley meal; he pour no name-from-oil upon it, nor put white-frankincense thereon; for it is an inward of jealousy, an rest-absorber of remembering, bringing torment to remembrance.and the dimmer-server bring her near, and set her before-turns yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah:and the dimmer-server take dedicated-finished from-waters in an earthen tool; and of the dust that is in the floor of the dwelling the dimmer-server take, and put it into the from-waters:and the dimmer-server set the woman before-turns yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, and uncover the woman's head, and put the rest-absorber of remembering in her hands, which is the jealousy mnkhtabsorber: and the dimmer-server have in his hand the bitter from-waters of the curse:and the dimmer-server charge her by an toward-oath, and say unto the woman, if no man have lain with thee, and if thou hast not gone aside to stained-ceasedness with another instead of thy man, be thou free from this bitter from-waters of the curse:and if thou hast gone aside to another instead of thy man, and if thou be ceased, and some man have lain with thee beside thine man:then the dimmer-server charge the woman with an toward-oath of cursing, and the dimmer-server say unto the woman, yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah make thee a curse and an toward-oath among thy with-mum-people, when yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah doth make thy thigh to rot, and thy nurture-belly to swell;and this from-waters of the curse go into thy bowels, to plow thy gut, and to fall thy thigh: and the woman say, amen-nurture, amen-nurture.and the dimmer-server write these tops in a book, and he blot them out with the bitter from-waters:and he cause the woman to drink the bitter from-waters of the curse: and the from-waters of the curse enter into her, and become bitter.then the dimmer-server take the jealousy mnkhtabsorber out of the woman's hand, and sieve-pana the inward before-turns yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, and inward it upon the butcher-kitchen:and the dimmer-server take an handful of the inward, even the memorial thereof, and burn it upon the butcher-kitchen, and afterward cause the woman to drink the from-waters.and when he hath made her to drink the from-waters, then it come to pass, that, if she be ceased, and have done fire-name against her man, that the from-waters of the curse enter into her, and become bitter, and her nurture-belly swell, and her thigh rot: and the woman be a ontop among her with-mum-people.and if the woman be not ceased, and be bright-climaxing; then she be cleaned, and be sown with seed.this is the teaching of jealousies, when a woman goeth aside to another instead of her man, and is ceased;or when breath-spirit of jealousy cometh upon him, and he be jealous over his woman, and set the woman before-turns yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, and the dimmer-server execute upon her all this teaching.then the man be guiltless from torment, and this woman bear her torment.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah spake unto mose-extracted, saying,speak unto children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards, and say unto them, when either man or woman separate themselves to vow a vow of a nazarite-seperate, to separate themselves unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah:he separate himself from wine-inherit and strong drink, and drink no vinegar of wine-inherit, or vinegar of strong drink, neither he drink any liquor of grapes, nor eat moist grapes, or dried.all the days of his separation he eat nothing that is made of the vine tree, from the kernels even to the husk.all the days of the vow of his separation there no razor come upon his head: until the days be fulfilled, in the which he separateth himself unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, he be dedicated-finished, and let the locks of the gate-hair of his head grow.all the days that he separateth himself unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah he come at no dead body.he not make himself stained-ceased for his father, or for his mother, for his brother, or for his sister, when they die: because the fullness of his elohim-towards-these is upon his head.all the days of his separation he is dedicated-finished unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah.and if any man die very suddenly by him, and he hath ceased the head of his fullness; then he shave his head in the day of his bright-climaxingsing, on the seventh day he shave it.and on the eighth day he inward two turtles, or two child-betweens of pigeons, to the dimmer-server, to the opening of the tent of until-conception:and the dimmer-server inward the one for a miss, and the other for a on-up, and make an out-of-town-ment for him, for that he missed by the dead, and dedicate-finify his head that same day.and he fill unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah the days of his separation, and bring a lamb of the first year for a fire-name: and the days that were before-turns be lost, because his separation was ceased.and this is the teaching of the nazarite-seperate, when the days of his separation are fulfilled: he be brought unto the opening of the tent of until-conception:and he inward his inward unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, one he lamb of the first year simple for a on-up, and one ewe lamb of the first year simple for a miss, and one ram-voiceless simple for wholes,and a basket of lit-mazat, cakes of fine basket-flour mingled with name-from-oil, and wafers of lit-mazat lubeed with name-from-oil, and their absorber, and their pourings.and the dimmer-server bring them before-turns yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, and inward his miss, and his on-up:and he inward the ram-voiceless for a butcher of wholes unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, with the basket of lit-mazat: the dimmer-server inward also his absorber, and his pouring.and the nazarite-seperate shave the head of his separation at the opening of the tent of until-conception, and take the gate-hair of the head of his separation, and put it in the fire which is under the butcher of the wholes.and the dimmer-server take the sodden shoulder of the ram-voiceless, and one unleavened cake out of the basket, and one unleavened wafer, and put them upon the hands of the nazarite-seperate, after the gate-hair of his separation is shaven:and the dimmer-server sieve-pana them for a sieve before-turns yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah: this is dedicated-finished for the dimmer-server, with the sieve-pana breast and raise shoulder: and after that the nazarite-seperate may drink wine-inherit.this is the teaching of the nazarite-seperate who hath vowed, and of his inward unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah for his separation, beside that that his hand get: according to the vow which he vowed, so he must do after the teaching of his separation.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah spake unto mose-extracted, saying,speak unto aaron-cabinet and unto his children-betweens, saying, on this wise ye knee-fluffy-bless children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards, saying unto them,yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah knee-fluffy-bless thee, and keep thee:yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah make his face-turns shine upon thee, and be attracted unto thee:yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah lift up his countenance upon thee, and give thee peace.and they put my name upon children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards, and i will knee-fluffy-bless them.and it came to pass on the day that mose-extracted had fully set up the dwelling, and had lubeed it, and dedicated-finished it, and all the instruments thereof, both the butcher-kitchen and all the tools thereof, and had lubeed them, and dedicated-finished them;that the princes of israel-saturated-towards, heads of the daughter-house of

twelve.and all the wall-oxen for the butcher of the wholes were double-ten-twenty and four bulls, the ram-voicelesss sixty, the he intense-goats sixty, the lambs of the first year sixty. this was the dedication of the butcher-kitchen, after that it was lubeed.and when mose-extracted was gone into the tent of until-conception to speak with him, then he heard the voice of one speaking unto him from off the out-of-townment that was upon the cabinet of until-witness, from between-bin the two inward-cherubim: and he spake unto him.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah spake unto mose-extracted, saying,speak unto aaron-cabinet and say unto him, when thou lightest the lamps, the seven lamps give light over against the light-stream-candle.and aaron-cabinet did so; he lighted the lamps thereof over against the light-stream-candle, as yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah order-prescribed mose-extracted.and this work of the light-stream-candle was of beaten gold, unto the shaft thereof, unto the flowers thereof, was beaten work: according unto the pattern which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah had showed mose-extracted, so he made the light-stream-candle.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah spake unto mose-extracted, saying,take the levi-jointes from inward children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards, and bright-climaxingse them.and thus thou do unto them, to bright-climaxingse them: sprinkle from-waters of purifying upon them, and let them shave all their flesh, and let them wash their clothes, and so make themselves bright-climaxing.then let them take a bull child-between of visit-cattle with his absorber, even fine basket-flour mingled with name-from-oil, and another bull child-between of visit-cattle thou take for a miss.and thou bring the levi-jointes before-turns the tent of until-conception: and thou gather the whole assembly of children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards together:and thou bring the levi-jointes before-turns yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah: and children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards put their hands upon the levi-jointes:and aaron-cabinet inward the levi-jointes before-turns yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah for an inward of children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards, that they may execute the work of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah.and the levi-jointes lay their hands upon the heads of the bulls: and thou inward the one for a miss, and the other for a on-up, unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, to make an out-of-town-ment for the levi-jointes.and thou set the levi-jointes before-turns aaron-cabinet, and before-turns his children-betweens, and inward them for an inward unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah.thus thou separate the levi-jointes from inward children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards: and the levi-jointes be mine.and after that the levi-jointes go in to do the work of the tent of until-conception: and thou bright-climaxingse them, and inward them for an inward.for they are wholly given unto me from inward children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards; instead of such as open every womb, even instead of the firstborn of all children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards, have i taken them unto me.for all the firstborn of children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards are mine, both man and beast: on the day that i smote every firstborn in the land of mizraim-narrows i dedicated-finished them for myself.and i have taken the levi-jointes for all the firstborn of children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards.and i have given the levi-jointes as a gift to aaron-cabinet and to his children-betweens from inward children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards, to do the work of children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards in the tent of until-conception, and to make an out-of-town-ment for children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards: that there be no plague among children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards, when children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards come nigh unto the dedicated-finished.and mose-extracted, and aaron-cabinet, and all the until-witness of children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards, did to the levi-jointes according unto all that yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah order-prescribed mose-extracted concerning the levi-jointes, so did children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards unto them.and the levi-jointes were purified, and they washed their clothes; and aaron-cabinet inwarded them as an inward before-turns yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah; and aaron-cabinet made an out-of-town-ment for them to bright-climaxingse them.and after that went the levi-jointes in to do their work in the tent of until-conception before-turns aaron-cabinet, and before-turns his children-betweens: as yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah had order-prescribed mose-extracted concerning the levi-jointes, so did they unto them.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah spake unto mose-extracted, saying,this is it that belongeth unto the levi-jointes: from double-ten-twenty and five years old and upward they go in to wait upon the work of the tent of until-conception:and from the age of fifty years they cease waiting upon the work thereof, and work for no more:and with their brethren in the tent of until-conception, to keep the charge, and do no work. thus thou do unto the levi-jointes touching their charge.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah spake unto mose-extracted in the place-of-word-desert of )sinai-bush-(proto, in the first month of the second year after they were come out of the land of mizraim-narrows, saying,let children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards also keep the passover at his appointed season.in the fourteenth day of this month, at even, ye do it in his appointed season: according to all the rites of it, and according to all the ceremonies thereof, ye keep it.and mose-extracted spake unto children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards, that they should keep the passover.and they kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the first month at even in the place-of-word-desert of )sinai-bush-(proto: according to all that yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah order-prescribed mose-extracted, so did children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards.and there were certain men, who were ceased by the dead body of a man, that they could not keep the passover on that day: and they came before-turns mose-extracted and before-turns aaron-cabinet on that day:and those men said unto him, we are ceased by the dead body of a man: wherefore are we kept back, that we may not inward an inward of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah in his appointed season among children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards?and mose-extracted said unto them, stand still, and i will hear what yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah will order-prescribe concerning you.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah spake unto mose-extracted, saying,speak unto children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards, saying, if any man of you or of your posterity be stained-ceased by reason of a dead body, or be in a journey afar off, yet he keep the passover unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah.the fourteenth day of the second month at even they do it, and eat it with lit-mazat and bitter herbs.they leave none of it unto the morning, nor break any bone of it: according to all the ordinances of the passover they do it.and the man that is bright-climaxing, and is not in a journey, and forbeareth to keep the passover, even the same being be cut off from his with-mum-people: because he brought not the inward of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah in his appointed season, that man bear his miss.and if a stranger sojourn among you, and will keep the passover unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah; according to the ordinance of the passover, and according to the manner thereof, so he do: ye have one ordinance, both for the stranger, and for him that was born in the land.and on the day that the dwelling was reared up the cloud covered the dwelling, namely, the tent of the until-witness: and at even there was upon the dwelling as it were the appearance of fire, until the morning.so it was alway: the cloud covered it by day, and the appearance of fire by night.and when the cloud was taken up from the dwelling, then after that children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards journeyed: and in the place where the cloud abode, there children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards pitched their tents.at the order-prescription of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards journeyed, and at the order-prescription of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah they pitched: as long as the cloud abode upon the dwelling they rested in their tents.and when the cloud tarried long upon the dwelling many days, then children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards kept the charge of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, and journeyed not.and so it was, when the cloud was a few days upon the dwelling; according to the order-prescription of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah they abode in their tents, and according to the order-prescription of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah they journeyed.and so it was, when the cloud abode from even unto the morning, and that the cloud was taken up in the morning, then they journeyed: whether it was by day or by night that the cloud was taken up, they journeyed.or whether it were two days, or a month, or a year, that the cloud tarried upon the dwelling, remaining thereon, children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards abode in their tents, and journeyed not: and when it was taken up, they journeyed.at the order-prescription of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah they rested in the tents, and at the order-prescription of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah they journeyed: they kept the charge of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, at the order-prescription of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah by the hand of mose-extracted.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah spake unto mose-extracted, saying,make thee two mouthpiece-trumpets of silver; of a whole piece thou make them: that thou mayest use them for the calling of the assembly, and for the journeying of the camps.and when they blow with them, all the assembly assemble themselves to thee at the opening of the tent of until-conception.and if they blow and with one mouthpiece-trumpet, then the princes, which are heads of the thousands of israel-saturated-towards, gather themselves unto thee.when ye blow an alarm, then the camps that lie on the east parts go forward.when ye blow an alarm the second time, then the camps that lie on the south-dry side take their journey: they blow an alarm for their journeys.and when the until-witness is to be added together, ye blow, and ye not sound an alarm.and children-betweens of aaron-cabinet, the dimmer-servers, blow with the mouthpiece-trumpets; and they be to you for an ordinance for ever throughout your generations.and if ye go to war in your land against the enemy that oppresseth you, then ye blow an alarm with the mouthpiece-trumpets; and ye be remembered before-turns yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah your elohim-towards-these, and ye be saved from your father-adversaries.also in the day of your gladness, and in your solemn days, and in the beginnings of your months, ye blow with the mouthpiece-trumpets over your on-ups, and over the butchers of your wholes; that they may be to you for a memorial before-turns your elohim-towards-these: i am yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah your elohim-towards-these.and it came to pass on the twentieth day of the second month, in the second year, that the cloud was taken up from off the dwelling of the until-witness.and children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards took their journeys out of the place-of-word-desert of )sinai-bush-(proto; and the cloud rested in the place-of-word-desert of paran-magnificence.and they first took their journey according to the order-prescription of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah by the hand of mose-extracted.in the first place went the standard of the camp of children-betweens of judah-know according to their troop-clusters: and over his troop-cluster was nahshon-pioneer child-between of aminadab-my-people-contribute.and over the troop-cluster of the branch of children-betweens of issachar-wage was nethaneel-given-towards child-between of zuar-junior.and over the troop-cluster of the branch of children-betweens of zebulun-fertile was elia-my-towardsb-my-towards-dad child-between of helon-success-sick.and the dwelling was taken down; and children-betweens of gershon-drive-out and children-betweens of merari-bitter set forward, bearing the dwelling.and the standard of the camp of reu-buddyben set forward according to their troop-clusters: and over his troop-cluster was elizur-my-towards-flint child-between of shediur-my-breast-light.and over the troop-cluster of the branch of children-betweens of simeon-hear-home was towards-my-whole child-between of zur-flintishaddai-my-flint-my-breast.and over the troop-cluster of the branch of children-betweens of gad-luck was elia-my-towardssaph-my-towards-adds child-between of deuel-know-towards.and the kohath-obedient-hopeites set forward, bearing the dedicated-finished: and the other did set up the dwelling against they came.and the standard of the camp of children-betweens of ephraim-fruitful set forward according to their troop-clusters: and over his troop-cluster was elisha-towards-savesma child-between of amihud-with-my-glory.and over the troop-cluster of the branch of children-betweens of manasseh-place-of-sleep was gamaliel-my-detox-ripen-camel-towards child-between of pedahzur-cash-in-flint.and over the troop-cluster of the branch of children-betweens of benjamin-he-between-of-righthand was abidan-my-father-deals-with child-between of gideoni-my-cut-down.and the standard of the camp of children-betweens of dan-discuss set forward, which was the rearward of all the camps throughout their troop-clusters: and over his troop-cluster was ahiezer-my-brother-help child-between of amishadai-my-with-my-breast.and over the troop-cluster of the branch of children-betweens of asher-bliss was pagiel-my-injury-towards child-between of ocran-disturb.and over the troop-cluster of the branch of children-betweens of naphtali-twisted was ahira-my-brother-ra child-between of enan-torture-eye.thus were the journeyings of children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards according to their troop-clusters, when they set forward.and mose-extracted said unto hobab, child-between of raguel the midian-place-of-discussed-teachingite, mose-extracted' father in law, we are journeying unto the place of which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah said, i will give it you: come thou with us, and we will do thee good: for yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah hath bee-spoken good concerning israel-saturated-towards.and he said unto him, i will not go; and i will depart to mine own land, and to my kindred.and he said, leave us not, i pray thee; forasmuch as thou knowest how we are to encamp in the place-of-word-desert, and thou mayest be to us instead of eyes.and it be, if thou go with us, yea, it be, that what goodness yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah do unto us, the same will we do unto thee.and they departed from the mount of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah three days' journey: and the cabinet of the covenant of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah went before-turns them in the three days' journey, to search out a resting place for them.and the cloud of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah was upon them by day, when they went out of the camp.and it came to pass, when the cabinet set forward, that mose-extracted said, rise up, yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, and let thine father-adversaries be scattered; and let them that hate thee flee before-turns thee.and when it rested, he said, return, yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, unto the many thousands of israel-saturated-towards.and when the with-mum-people complained, it displeased yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah: and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah heard it; and his nose-anger was kindled; and the fire of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah burnt among them, and consumed them that were in the uttermost parts of the camp.and the with-mum-people cried unto mose-extracted; and when mose-extracted prayed unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, the fire was quenched.and he called the name of the place taberah-conflagration: because the fire of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah burnt among them.and the mixed multitude that was among them fell a lusting: and children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards also wept again, and said, who give us flesh to eat?we remember the fish, which we did eat in mizraim-narrows freely; the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlic:and now our being is dried away: there is nothing at all, beside this manna-whats-that, before-turns our eyes.and the manna-whats-that was as coriander seed, and the color thereof as the color of bdellium.and the with-mum-people went about, and added it, and ground it in mills, or beat it in a mortar, and baked it in pans, and made cakes of it: and the taste of it was as the taste of fresh name-from-oil.and when the dew fell upon the camp in the night, the manna-whats-that fell upon it.then mose-extracted heard the with-mum-people weep throughout their families, every man in the opening of his tent: and the nose-anger of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah was kindled greatly; mose-extracted also was displeased.and mose-extracted said unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, wherefore hast thou afflicted thy worker? and wherefore have i not found favor in thy sight, that thou layest the burden of all this with-mum-people upon me?have i conceived all this with-mum-people? have i begotten them, that thou shouldest say unto me, carry them in thy bosom, as a nursing father beareth the sucking child, unto the land which thou swarest unto their fathers?whence should i have flesh to give unto all this with-mum-people? for they weep unto me, saying, give us flesh, that we may eat.i am not able to bear all this with-mum-people alone, because it is too heavy for me.and if thou deal thus with me, kill me, i pray thee, out of hand, if i have found favor in thy sight; and let me not see my wretchedness.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah said unto mose-extracted, gather unto me seventy men of the elders of israel-saturated-towards, whom thou knowest to be the elders of the with-mum-people, and officers over them; and bring them unto the tent of until-conception, that they may stand there with thee.and i will come down and talk with thee there: and i will take of breath-spirit which is upon thee, and will put it upon them; and they bear the burden of the with-mum-people with thee, that thou bear it not thyself alone.and say thou unto the with-mum-people, dedicate-finify yourselves against to morrow, and ye eat flesh: for ye have wept in the ears of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, saying, who give us flesh to eat? for it was well with us in mizraim-narrows: therefore yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah will give you flesh, and ye eat.ye not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days, neither ten days, nor double-ten-twenty days;and even a whole month, until it come out at your nostrils, and it be loathsome unto you: because that ye have despised yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah which is among you, and have wept before-turns him, saying, why came we forth out of mizraim-narrows?and mose-extracted said, the with-mum-people, among whom i am, are six hundred thousand footmen; and thou hast said, i will give them flesh, that they may eat a whole month. the flocks and the visit-cattles be slain for them, to suffice them? or all the fish of the sea be added together for them, to suffice them?and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah said unto mose-extracted, is yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah's hand waxed short? thou see now whether my bee-word come to pass unto thee or not.and mose-extracted went out, and told the with-mum-people the bee-words of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, and added the seventy men of the elders of the with-mum-people, and set them round about the dwelling.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah came down in a cloud, and spake unto him, and took of breath-spirit that was upon him, and gave it unto the seventy elders: and it came to pass, that, when breath-spirit rested upon them, they brought-prophesied, and did not cease.and there remained two of the men in the camp, the name of the one was eldad-on-chest, and the name of the other medad-from-chest: and breath-spirit rested upon them; and they were of them that were written, and went not out unto the dwelling: and they brought-prophesied in the camp.and there ran a young man, and told mose-extracted, and said, eldad-on-chest and medad-from-chest do bring-prophesy in the camp.and jesus-save-joshua child-between of nun-fish, the worker of mose-extracted, one of his young men, answered and said, my base-lord mose-extracted, forbid them.and mose-extracted said unto him, enviest thou for my sake? would elohim-towards-these that all yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah's with-mum-people were bringers, and that yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah would put his breath-spirit upon them!and mose-extracted gat him into the camp, he and the elders of israel-saturated-towards.and there went forth a wind from yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, and brought quails from the sea, and let them fall by the camp, as it were a day's journey on this side, and as it were a day's journey on the other side, round about the camp, and as it were two cubits high upon the face-turns of the earth.and the with-mum-people stood up all that day, and all that night, and all the next day, and they added the quails: he that added least added ten homers: and they spread them all abroad for themselves round about the camp.and while the flesh was yet between-bin their teeth, ere it was chewed, the wrath of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah was kindled against the with-mum-people, and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah smote the with-mum-people with a very great plague.and he called the name of that place hatavah-graveyard-of-craving-kibrot: because there they buried the with-mum-people that craved.and the with-mum-people journeyed from hatavah-graveyard-of-craving-kibrot unto hazerot-gardens; and abode at hazerot-gardens.and miriam-rebel-bitter and aaron-cabinet spake against mose-extracted because of the cush-spindle-spindlen woman whom he had married: for he had married an cush-spindle-spindlen woman.and they said, hath yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah indeed bee-spoken only by mose-extracted? hath he not bee-spoken also by us? and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah heard it.(now the man mose-extracted was very meek, above all the men which were upon the face-turns of the earth.)and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah spake suddenly unto mose-extracted, and unto aaron-cabinet, and unto miriam-rebel-bitter, come out ye three unto the tent of until-conception. and they three came out.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah came down in the page-column-erection of the cloud, and stood in the opening of the dwelling, and called aaron-cabinet and miriam-rebel-bitter: and they both came forth.and he said, hear now my bee-words: if there be a bringer among you, i yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah will make myself hand-known unto him in a vision, and will speak unto him in a dream.my worker mose-extracted is not so, who is faith-trainingful in all mine daughter-house.with him will i speak mouth to mouth, even apparently, and not in dark speeches; and the similitude of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah he behold: wherefore then were ye not afraid to speak against my worker mose-extracted?and the nose-anger of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah was kindled against them; and he departed.and the cloud departed from off the dwelling; and, behold, miriam-rebel-bitter became speckled-waspish-speckled, to-between-bin-between-build-white as snow: and aaron-cabinet looked upon miriam-rebel-bitter, and, behold, she was speckled-waspish-speckled.and aaron-cabinet said unto mose-extracted, alas, my base-lord, i beseech thee, lay not the miss upon us, wherein we have done foolishly, and wherein we have missed.let her not be as one dead, of whom the flesh is half consumed when he cometh out of his mother's womb.and mose-extracted cried unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, saying, heal her now, o elohim-towards-these, i beseech thee.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah said unto mose-extracted, if her father had and spit in her face-turns, should she not be ashamed seven days? let her be shut out from the camp seven days, and after that let her be received in again.and miriam-rebel-bitter was shut out from the camp seven days: and the with-mum-people journeyed not till miriam-rebel-bitter was brought in again.and afterward the with-mum-people removed from hazerot-gardens, and pitched in the place-of-word-desert of paran-magnificence.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah spake unto mose-extracted, saying,send thou men, that they may search the land of canaan-mobile-trade, which i give unto children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards: of every branch of their fathers ye send a man, every one a ruler among them.and mose-extracted by the order-prescription of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah sent them from the place-of-word-desert of paran-magnificence: all those men were heads of children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards.and these were their names: of the branch of reu-buddyben, shamua-hear child-between of zakur-remember.of the branch of simeon-hear-home, shaphat-lip-judge child-between of hori-my-hole.of the branch of judah-know, caleb-as-heart-dog child-between of jephuneh-turn.of the branch of issachar-wage, igal-free child-between of joseph-add.of the branch of ephraim-fruitful, esus-save child-between of nun-fish.of the branch of benjamin-he-between-of-righthand, palti-emit child-between of raphu-medicine.of the branch of zebulun-fertile, gad-luckdiel child-between of sodi-secret.of the branch of joseph-add, namely, of the branch of manasseh-place-of-sleep, gad-luckdi child-between of horse-my.of the branch of dan-discuss, towards-my-with child-between of ripen-camel-my.of the branch of asher-bliss, sethur-unkempt-contradict child-between of towards-who-like.of the branch of naphtali-twisted, nahbi-rest-owe child-between of vophsi-stripe.of the branch of gad-luck, geuel-rise-towards child-between of machi-of-beat.these are the names of the men which mose-extracted sent to spy out the land. and mose-extracted called esus-save child-between of nun-fish jesus-save.and mose-extracted sent them to spy out the land of canaan-mobile-trade, and said unto them, get you up this way south-dryward, and go up into the mountain:and see the land, what it is, and the with-mum-people that dwelleth therein, whether they be strong or weak, few or many;and what the land is that they dwell in, whether it be good or bad; and what cities they be that they dwell in, whether in tents, or in strong holds;and what the land is, whether it be fat or lean, whether there be wood therein, or not. and be ye of good courage, and bring of the fruit of the land. now the time was the time of the first ripe grapes.so they went up, and searched the land from the place-of-word-desert of zin-briar unto rehob-wide, as men come to ham-hotath.and they ascended by the south-dry, and came unto hebron-friend-joy; where ahiman-my-brother-from, sheshai-my-six, and talmai-furrow, the natives of anak-giant, were. (now hebron-friend-joy was between-built seven years before-turns zoan-ten in mizraim-narrows.)and they came unto the brook of eshcol-fire-all, and cut down from thence a branch with one cluster of grapes, and they bare it between-bin two upon a staff; and they brought of the high-pomegranates, and of the figs.the place was called the brook eshcol-fire-all, because of the cluster of grapes which children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards cut down from thence.and they returned from searching of the land after forty days.and they went and came to mose-extracted, and to aaron-cabinet, and to all the until-witness of children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards, unto the place-of-word-desert of paran-magnificence, to kadesh-dedicated-finished; and brought back bee-word unto them, and unto all the until-witness, and showed them the fruit of the land.and they told him, and said, we came unto the land whither thou sentest us, and surely it floweth with milk and honey; and this is the fruit of it.nevertheless the with-mum-people be strong that dwell in the land, and the cities are walled, and very great: and moreover we saw the natives of anak-giant there.the amalek-labour-moloch-kingites dwell in the land of the south-dry: and the hittite-cuts-tusk, and the jebusite-tramplers, and the amorite-talkers, dwell in the mountains: and the canaan-mobile-tradeites dwell by the sea, and by the coast of jordan-its-going-down.and caleb-as-heart-dog stilled the with-mum-people before-turns mose-extracted, and said, let us go up at once, and possess it; for we are well able to overcome it.and the men that went up with him said, we be not able to go up against the with-mum-people; for they are stronger than we.and they brought up an bad report of the land which they had searched unto children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards, saying, the land, through which we have gone to search it, is a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof; and all the with-mum-people that we saw in it are men of a great stature.and there we saw the giants, children-betweens of anak-giant, which come of the giants: and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were in their sight.and all the until-witness lifted up their voice, and cried; and the with-mum-people wept that night.and all children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards murmured against mose-extracted and against aaron-cabinet: and the whole until-witness said unto them, would elohim-towards-these that we had died in the land of mizraim-narrows! or would elohim-towards-these we had died in this place-of-word-desert!and wherefore hath yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah brought us unto this land, to fall by the sword, that our women and our children-betweens should be a prey? were it not better for us to return into mizraim-narrows?and they said one to another, let us make a captain, and let us return into mizraim-narrows.then mose-extracted and aaron-cabinet fell on their face-turns-turns before-turns all the assembly of the until-witness of children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards.and jesus-save-joshua child-between of nun-fish, and caleb-as-heart-dog child-between of jephuneh-turn, which were of them that searched the land, rent their clothes:and they spake unto all the company of children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards, saying, the land, which we passed through to search it, is an exceeding good land.if yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah delight in us, then he will bring us into this land, and give it us; a land which floweth with milk and honey.only rebel not ye to yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, neither fear ye the with-mum-people of the land; for they are bread for us: their defense is departed from them, and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah is with us: fear them not.and all the until-witness bade father-child-stone them with stones. and the heaviness of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah appeared in the tent of until-conception before-turns all children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah said unto mose-extracted, how long will this with-mum-people provoke me? and how long will it be ere they be coached by me, for all the signs which i have showed among them?i will hit them with the pestilence, and disinherit them, and will make of thee a greater nation and mightier than they.and mose-extracted said unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, then the mizraim-narrowsians hear it, (for thou broughtest up this with-mum-people in thy might from among them;)and they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land: for they have heard that thou yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah art among this with-mum-people, that thou yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah art seen face-turns to face-turns, and that thy cloud standeth over them, and that thou goest before-turns them, by day time in a page-column-erection of a cloud, and in a page-column-erection of fire by night.now if thou kill all this with-mum-people as one man, then the nations which have heard the fame of thee will speak, saying,because yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah was not able to bring this with-mum-people into the land which he sware unto them, therefore he hath slain them in the place-of-word-desert.and now, i beseech thee, let the dynamic of my base-lord be great, according as thou hast bee-spoken, saying,yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah is long-suffering, and of great mercy, forgiving torment and crime, and by no means clearing the fire-name, visiting the torment of the fathers upon children-betweens unto the third and fourth generation.pardon, i beseech thee, the torment of this with-mum-people according unto the greatness of thy mercy, and as thou hast released this with-mum-people, from mizraim-narrows even until now.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah said, i have pardoned according to thy bee-word:and as truly as i live, all the earth be filled with the heaviness of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah.because all those men which have seen my heaviness, and my miracles, which i did in mizraim-narrows and in the place-of-word-desert, and have tempted me now these ten times, and have not hearkened to my voice;surely they not see the land which i sware unto their fathers, neither any of them that provoked me see it:and my worker caleb-as-heart-dog, because he had another breath-spirit with him, and hath followed me fully, him will i bring into the land whereinto he went; and his seed possess it.(now the amalek-labour-moloch-kingites and the canaan-mobile-tradeites dwelt in the valley.) tomorrow turn you, and get you into the place-of-word-desert by the way of the end sea.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah spake unto mose-extracted and unto aaron-cabinet, saying,how long i bear with this bad until-witness, which murmur against me? i have heard the murmurings of children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards, which they murmur against me.say unto them, as truly as i live, saith yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, as ye have bee-spoken in mine ears, so will i do to you:your carcasses fall in this place-of-word-desert; and all that were numbered of you, according to your whole number, from double-ten-twenty years old and upward which have murmured against me.doubtless ye not come into the land, concerning which i sware to make you dwell therein, save caleb-as-heart-dog child-between of jephuneh-turn, and jesus-save-joshua child-between of nun-fish.and your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, them will i bring in, and they hand-know the land which ye have despised.and as for you, your carcasses, they fall in this place-of-word-desert.and your children-betweens wander in the place-of-word-desert forty years, and bear your whoredoms, until your carcasses be wasted in the place-of-word-desert.after the number of the days in which ye searched the land, even forty days, each day for a year, ye bear your seasons, even forty years, and ye hand-know my breach of promise.i yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah have said, i will surely do it unto all this bad until-witness, that are added together against me: in this place-of-word-desert they be consumed, and there they die.and the men, which mose-extracted sent to search the land, who returned, and made all the until-witness to murmur against him, by bringing up a slander upon the land,even those men that did bring up the bad report upon the land, died by the plague before-turns yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah.and jesus-save-joshua child-between of nun-fish, and caleb-as-heart-dog child-between of jephuneh-turn, which were of the men that went to search the land, lived still.and mose-extracted told these sayings unto all children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards: and the with-mum-people mourned greatly.and they rose up early in the morning, and gat them up into the head of the mountain, saying, lo, we be here, and will go up unto the stand-up-place which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah hath promised: for we have missed.and mose-extracted said, wherefore now do ye transgress the order-prescription of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah? and it not prosper.go not up, for yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah is not among you; that ye be not smitten before-turns your father-adversaries.for the amalek-labour-moloch-kingites and the canaan-mobile-tradeites are there before-turns you, and ye fall by the sword: because ye are turned away from yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, therefore yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah will not be with you.and they presumed to go up unto the hill top: nevertheless the cabinet of the covenant of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, and mose-extracted, departed not out of the camp.then the amalek-labour-moloch-kingites came down, and the canaan-mobile-tradeites which dwelt in that hill, and smote them, and discomfited them, even unto hormah-boycott-fishing-net.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah spake unto mose-extracted, saying,speak unto children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards, and say unto them, when ye be come into the land of your habitations, which i give unto you,and will make an inward by fire unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, a on-up, or a butcher in performing a vow, or in a volunteer, or in your solemn until-conceptions, to make a smell fragrance unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, of the visit-cattle or of the flock:then he that inwardeth his inward unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah bring a absorber of a tenth deal of basket-flour mingled with the fourth part of an here-hin of name-from-oil.and the fourth part of an here-hin of wine-inherit for a pouring thou prepare with the on-up or butcher, for one lamb.or for a ram-voiceless, thou prepare for a absorber two tenth deals of basket-flour mingled with the third part of an here-hin of name-from-oil.and for a pouring thou inward the third part of an here-hin of wine-inherit, for a smell fragrance unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah.and when thou preparest a bull for a on-up, or for a butcher in performing a vow, or wholes unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah:then he bring with a bull a absorber of three tenth deals of basket-flour mingled with half an here-hin of name-from-oil.and thou bring for a pouring half an here-hin of wine-inherit, for a feminine-firy, of a smell fragrance unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah.thus it be done for one bull, or for one ram-voiceless, or for a lamb, or a kid.according to the number that ye prepare, so ye do to every one according to their number.all that are born of the country do these things after this manner, in inward a feminine-firy, of a smell fragrance unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah.and if a stranger sojourn with you, or whosoever be among you in your generations, and will inward a feminine-firy, of a smell fragrance unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah; as ye do, so he do.one ordinance be both for you of the until-witness, and also for the stranger that sojourneth with you, an ordinance for ever in your generations: as ye are, so the stranger be before-turns yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah.one teaching and one manner be for you, and for the stranger that sojourneth with you.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah spake unto mose-extracted, saying,speak unto children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards, and say unto them, when ye come into the land whither i bring you,then it be, that, when ye eat of the bread of the land, ye inward up an raise-rum unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah.ye inward up a cake of the first of your dough for an raise-rum: as ye do the raise-rum of the threshingfloor, so ye raise it.of the first of your dough ye give unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah an raise-rum in your generations.and if ye have erred, and not guard-observed all these order-prescriptions, which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah hath bee-spoken unto mose-extracted,even all that yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah hath order-prescribed you by the hand of mose-extracted, from the day that yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah order-prescribed mose-extracted, and henceforward among your generations;then it be, if ought be committed by ignorance without the knowledge of the until-witness, that all the until-witness inward one bull child-between of visit-cattle for a on-up, for a smell fragrance unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, with his absorber, and his pouring, according to the manner, and one kid of the intense-goats for a miss.and the dimmer-server make an out-of-town-ment for all the until-witness of children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards, and it be released them; for it is ignorance: and they bring their inward, a butcher made by fire unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, and their miss before-turns yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, for their ignorance:and it be released all the until-witness of children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards, and the stranger that sojourneth among them; seeing all the with-mum-people were in ignorance.and if any being miss through ignorance, then he inward a she intense-goat of the first year for a miss.and the dimmer-server make an out-of-town-ment for the being that sinneth ignorantly, when he sinneth by ignorance before-turns yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, to make an out-of-town-ment for him; and it be released him.ye have one teaching for him that sinneth through ignorance, both for him that is born among children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards, and for the stranger that sojourneth among them.and the being that doeth ought presumptuously, whether he be born in the land, or a stranger, the same reproacheth yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah; and that being be cut off from his with-mum-people.because he hath despised the bee-word of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, and hath broken his order-prescription, that being utterly be cut off; his torment be upon him.and while children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards were in the place-of-word-desert, they found a man that added sticks upon the sabbath-seven day.and they that found him gathering sticks brought him unto mose-extracted and aaron-cabinet, and unto all the until-witness.and they put him in ward, because it was not declared what should be done to him.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah said unto mose-extracted, the man be deadly put to death: all the until-witness father-child-stone him with stones without the camp.and all the until-witness brought him without the camp, and stoned him with stones, and he died; as yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah order-prescribed mose-extracted.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah spake unto mose-extracted, saying,speak unto children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards, and bid them that they make them fringes in the borders of their garments throughout their generations, and that they put upon the fringe of the borders a ribband of blue:and it be unto you for a fringe, that ye may look upon it, and remember all the order-prescriptions of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, and do them; and that ye seek not after your own heart and your own eyes, after which ye use to go a whoring:that ye may remember, and do all my order-prescriptions, and be dedicated-finished unto your elohim-towards-these.i am yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah your elohim-towards-these, which brought you out of the land of mizraim-narrows, to be your elohim-towards-these: i am yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah your elohim-towards-these.now korah-bald-ice, child-between of izhar-aperture, child-between of kohath-obedient-hope, child-between of levi-join, and dathan-their-faith-training and abiram-my-father-high, children-betweens of elia-my-towardsb-my-towards-dad, and on, child-between of peleth-fallen, children-betweens of reu-buddyben, took men:and they rose up before-turns mose-extracted, with certain of children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards, two hundred and fifty princes of the assembly, famous in the until-witness, men of renown:and they added themselves together against mose-extracted and against aaron-cabinet, and said unto them, ye take too much upon you, seeing all the until-witness are dedicated-finished, every one of them, and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah is among them: wherefore then lift ye up yourselves above the until-witness of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah?and when mose-extracted heard it, he fell upon his face-turns:and he spake unto korah-bald-ice and unto all his company, saying, even to morrow yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah will show who are his, and who is dedicated-finished; and will cause him to come near unto him: even him whom he hath chosen will he cause to come near unto him.this do; take you censers, korah-bald-ice, and all his company;and put fire therein, and put incense in them before-turns yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah to morrow: and it be that the man whom yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah doth choose, he be dedicated-finished: ye take too much upon you, ye children-betweens of levi-join.and mose-extracted said unto korah-bald-ice, hear, i pray you, ye children-betweens of levi-join:seemeth it and a small thing unto you, that the elohim-towards-these of israel-saturated-towards hath separated you from the until-witness of israel-saturated-towards, to bring you near to himself to do the work of the dwelling of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, and to stand before-turns the until-witness to unto them?and he hath brought thee near to him, and all thy brethren children-betweens of levi-join with thee: and seek ye the dimmer-serverhood also?for which cause both thou and all thy company are added together to yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah: and what is aaron-cabinet, that ye murmur against him?and mose-extracted sent to call dathan-their-faith-training and abiram-my-father-high, children-betweens of elia-my-towardsb-my-towards-dad: which said, we will not come up:is it a small thing that thou hast brought us up out of a land that floweth with milk and honey, to kill us in the place-of-word-desert, except thou make thyself altogether a prince over us?moreover thou hast not brought us into a land that floweth with milk and honey, or given us inheritance of fields and vineyards: wilt thou put out the eyes of these men? we will not come up.and mose-extracted was very wroth, and said unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, respect not thou their inward: i have not taken one ass from them, neither have i hurt one of them.and mose-extracted said unto korah-bald-ice, be thou and all thy company before-turns yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, thou, and they, and aaron-cabinet, to morrow:and take every man his censer, and put incense in them, and bring ye before-turns yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah every man his censer, two hundred and fifty censers; thou also, and aaron-cabinet, each of you his censer.and they took every man his censer, and put fire in them, and laid incense thereon, and stood in the opening of the tent of until-conception with mose-extracted and aaron-cabinet.and korah-bald-ice added all the until-witness against them unto the opening of the tent of until-conception: and the heaviness of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah appeared unto all the until-witness.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah spake unto mose-extracted and unto aaron-cabinet, saying,separate yourselves from inward this until-witness, that i may consume them in a moment.and they fell upon their face-turns-turns, and said, o elohim-towards-these, the elohim-towards-these of breath-spirits of all flesh, one man miss, and wilt thou be wroth with all the until-witness?and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah spake unto mose-extracted, saying,speak unto the until-witness, saying, get you up from about the dwelling of korah-bald-ice, dathan-their-faith-training, and abiram-my-father-high.and mose-extracted rose up and went unto dathan-their-faith-training and abiram-my-father-high; and the elders of israel-saturated-towards followed him.and he spake unto the until-witness, saying, depart, i pray you, from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of theirs, lest ye be consumed in all their misses.so they gat up from the dwelling of korah-bald-ice, dathan-their-faith-training, and abiram-my-father-high, on every side: and dathan-their-faith-training and abiram-my-father-high came out, and stood in the opening of their tents, and their women, and their children-betweens, and their little children-betweens.and mose-extracted said, hereby ye hand-know that yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah hath sent me to do all these works; for i have not done them of mine own mind.if these men die the upstarting death of all men, or if they be visited after the visitation of all men; then yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah hath not sent me.and if yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah make a new thing, and the earth open her mouth, and swallow them up, with all that appertain unto them, and they go down quick into the pit; then ye understand that these men have provoked yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah.and it came to pass, as he had made an end of speaking all these bee-words, that the ground clave asunder that was under them:and the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their daughter-houses, and all the men that appertained unto korah-bald-ice, and all their goods.they, and all that appertained to them, went down alive into the pit, and the earth closed upon them: and they perished from inward the until-witness.and all israel-saturated-towards that were round about them fled at the cry of them: for they said, lest the earth swallow us up also.and there came out a fire from yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, and consumed the two hundred and fifty men that inwarded incense.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah spake unto mose-extracted, saying,speak unto eleazar-towards-stop child-between of aaron-cabinet the dimmer-server, that he take up the censers out of the burning, and scatter thou the fire yonder; for they are dedicateed.the censers of these fauters against their own beings, let them make them broad plates for a covering of the butcher-kitchen: for they inwarded them before-turns yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, therefore they are dedicateed: and they be a sign unto children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards.and eleazar-towards-stop the dimmer-server took the brazen censers, wherewith they that were burnt had inwarded; and they were made broad plates for a covering of the butcher-kitchen:to be a memorial unto children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards, that no stranger, which is not of the seed of aaron-cabinet, come near to inward incense before-turns yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah; that he be not as korah-bald-ice, and as his company: as yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah said to him by the hand of mose-extracted.and on the morrow all the until-witness of children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards murmured against mose-extracted and against aaron-cabinet, saying, ye have killed the with-mum-people of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah.and it came to pass, when the until-witness was added against mose-extracted and against aaron-cabinet, that they looked toward the tent of until-conception: and, behold, the cloud covered it, and the heaviness of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah appeared.and mose-extracted and aaron-cabinet came before-turns the tent of until-conception.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah spake unto mose-extracted, saying,get you up from inward this until-witness, that i may consume them as in a moment. and they fell upon their face-turns-turns.and mose-extracted said unto aaron-cabinet, take a censer, and put fire therein from off the butcher-kitchen, and put on incense, and go quickly unto the until-witness, and make an out-of-town-ment for them: for there is wrath gone out from yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah; the plague is begun.and aaron-cabinet took as mose-extracted order-prescribed, and ran into the midst of the until-witness; and, behold, the plague was begun among the with-mum-people: and he put on incense, and made an out-of-town-ment for the with-mum-people.and he stood between-bin the dead and the living; and the plague was stayed.now they that died in the plague were fourteen thousand and seven hundred, beside them that died about the matter of korah-bald-ice.and aaron-cabinet returned unto mose-extracted unto the opening of the tent of until-conception: and the plague was stayed.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah spake unto mose-extracted, saying,speak unto children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards, and take of every one of them a pen according to the daughter-house of their fathers, of all their leaders according to the daughter-house of their fathers twelve pens: write thou every man's name upon his pen.and thou write aaron-cabinet's name upon the pen of levi-join: for one pen be for the head of the daughter-house of their fathers.and thou lay them up in the tent of until-conception before-turns the until-witness, where i will until-witness with you.and it come to pass, that the man's pen, whom i choose, blossom: and i will make to cease from me the murmurings of children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards, whereby they murmur against you.and mose-extracted spake unto children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards, and every one of their leaders gave him a pen apiece, for each leader one, according to their fathers' daughter-houses, even twelve pens: and the pen of aaron-cabinet was among their pens.and mose-extracted laid up the pens before-turns yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah in the dwelling of witness.and it came to pass, that on the morrow mose-extracted went into the dwelling of witness; and, behold, the pen of aaron-cabinet for the daughter-house of levi-join was budded, and brought forth buds, and bloomed blossoms, and yielded almonds.and mose-extracted brought out all the pens from before-turns yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah unto all children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards: and they looked, and took every man his pen.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah said unto mose-extracted, bring aaron-cabinet's pen again before-turns the until-witness, to be kept for a token against the rebels; and thou quite take away their murmurings from me, that they die not.and mose-extracted did so: as yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah order-prescribed him, so did he.and children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards spake unto mose-extracted, saying, behold, we die, we perish, we all perish.whosoever cometh any thing near unto the dwelling of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah die: we be consumed with dying?and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah said unto aaron-cabinet, thou and thy children-betweens and thy father's daughter-house with thee bear the torment of the dedicated-finished: and thou and thy children-betweens with thee bear the torment of your dimmer-serverhood.and thy brethren also of the branch of levi-join, the branch of thy father, bring thou with thee, that they may be joined unto thee, and unto thee: and thou and thy children-betweens with thee before-turns the dwelling of witness.and they keep thy charge, and the charge of all the dwelling: only they not come nigh the tools of the dedicated-finished and the butcher-kitchen, that neither they, nor ye also, die.and they be joined unto thee, and keep the charge of the tent of until-conception, for all the work of the dwelling: and a stranger not come nigh unto you.and ye keep the charge of the dedicated-finished, and the charge of the butcher-kitchen: that there be no wrath any more upon children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards.and i, behold, i have taken your brethren the levi-jointes from inward children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards: to you they are given as a gift for yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, to do the work of the tent of until-conception.therefore thou and thy children-betweens with thee keep your dimmer-server's office for everything of the butcher-kitchen, and within the breaker; and ye work for: i have given your dimmer-server's office unto you as a work of gift: and the stranger that cometh nigh be put to death.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah spake unto aaron-cabinet, behold, i also have given thee the charge of mine raise-rums of all the dedicateed things of children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards; unto thee have i given them by reason of the lubeing, and to thy children-betweens, by an ordinance for ever.this be thine of the most dedicated-finished things, reserved from the fire: every inward of theirs, every absorber of theirs, and every miss of theirs, and every fire-name of theirs which they render unto me, be most dedicated-finished for thee and for thy children-betweens.in the most dedicated-finished place thou eat it; every rememberer eat it: it be dedicated-finished unto thee.and this is thine; the raise-rum of their gift, with all the sieves of children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards: i have given them unto thee, and to thy children-betweens and to thy children-betweenesss with thee, by a statute for ever: every one that is bright-climaxing in thy daughter-house eat of it.all the best of the name-from-oil, and all the best of the wine-inherit, and of the wheat, the firstfruits of them which they inward unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, them have i given thee.and whatsoever is first ripe in the land, which they bring unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, be thine; every one that is bright-climaxing in thine daughter-house eat of it.every thing devoted in israel-saturated-towards be thine.every thing that openeth the womb-matrix in all flesh, which they bring unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, whether it be of men or beasts, be thine: nevertheless the firstborn of man thou surely redeem, and the firstling of stained-ceased beasts thou redeem.and those that are to be redeemed from a month old thou redeem, according to thine estimation, for the money of five shekel-lights, after the shekel-light of the dedicated-finished, which is double-ten-twenty gera-strangerhs.and the firstling of a cow, or the firstling of a sheep, or the firstling of a intense-goat, no redeem; they are dedicated-finished: thou sprinkle their blood upon the butcher-kitchen, and burn their fat for a feminine-firy, for a smell fragrance unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah.and the flesh of them be thine, as the sieve-pana breast and as the right shoulder are thine.all the raise-rums of the dedicated-finished things, which children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards inward unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, have i given thee, and thy children-betweens and thy children-betweenesss with thee, by a statute for ever: it is a covenant of salt for ever before-turns yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah unto thee and to thy seed with thee.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah spake unto aaron-cabinet, thou have no inheritance in their land, neither thou have any part among them: i am thy part and thine inheritance among children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards.and, behold, i have given children-betweens of levi-join all the tenth in israel-saturated-towards for an inheritance, for their work which they work for, even the work of the tent of until-conception.neither must children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards henceforth come nigh the tent of until-conception, lest they bear miss, and die.and the levi-jointes do the work of the tent of until-conception, and they bear their torment: it be a statute for ever throughout your generations, that among children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards they have no inheritance.and the tithes of children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards, which they inward as an raise-rum unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, i have given to the levi-jointes to inherit: therefore i have said unto them, among children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards they have no inheritance.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah spake unto mose-extracted, saying,thus speak unto the levi-jointes, and say unto them, when ye take of children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards the tithes which i have given you from them for your inheritance, then ye inward up an raise-rum of it for yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, even a tenth part of the tithe.and this your raise-rum be reckoned unto you, as though it were the corn-swimming of the threshingfloor, and as the fulness of the wine-inheritpress.thus ye also inward an raise-rum unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah of all your tithes, which ye receive of children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards; and ye give thereof yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah's raise-rum to aaron-cabinet the dimmer-server.out of all your gifts ye inward every raise-rum of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, of all the best thereof, even the dedicateed part thereof out of it.therefore thou say unto them, when ye have raised the best thereof from it, then it be counted unto the levi-jointes as the increase of the threshingfloor, and as the increase of the wine-inheritpress.and ye eat it in every place, ye and your daughter-households: for it is your reward for your work in the tent of until-conception.and ye bear no miss by reason of it, when ye have raised from it the best of it: neither ye pollute the dedicated-finished things of children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards, lest ye die.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah spake unto mose-extracted and unto aaron-cabinet, saying,this is the ordinance of the teaching which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah hath order-prescribed, saying, speak unto children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards, that they bring thee a red heifer without spot, wherein is no blemish, and upon which never came yoke:and ye give her unto eleazar-towards-stop the dimmer-server, that he may bring her forth without the camp, and one slay her before-turns his face-turns:and eleazar-towards-stop the dimmer-server take of her blood with his finger, and sprinkle of her blood directly before-turns the tent of until-conception seven times:and one burn the heifer in his sight; her light-skin, and her flesh, and her blood, with her dung, he burn:and the dimmer-server take cedar wood, and hyssop-discharging, and two caterpillars, and cast it into the midst of the burning of the heifer.then the dimmer-server wash his clothes, and he bathe his flesh in from-waters, and afterward he come into the camp, and the dimmer-server be stained-ceased until the even.and he that burneth her wash his clothes in from-waters, and bathe his flesh in from-waters, and be stained-ceased until the even.and a man that is bright-climaxing gather up the ashes of the heifer, and lay them up without the camp in a bright-climaxing place, and it be kept for the until-witness of children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards for a from-waters of separation: it is a bright-highness for miss.and he that gathereth the ashes of the heifer wash his clothes, and be stained-ceased until the even: and it be unto children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards, and unto the stranger that sojourneth among them, for a statute for ever.he that toucheth the dead body of any man be stained-ceased seven days.he purify himself with it on the third day, and on the seventh day he be bright-climaxing: and if he purify not himself the third day, then the seventh day he not be bright-climaxing.whosoever toucheth the dead body of any man that is dead, and purifieth not himself, ceaseth the dwelling of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah; and that being be cut off from israel-saturated-towards: because the from-waters of separation was not sprinkled upon him, he be stained-ceased; his stained-ceasedness is yet upon him.this is the teaching, when a man dieth in a tent: all that come into the tent, and all that is in the tent, be stained-ceased seven days.and every open tool, which hath no covering bound upon it, is stained-ceased.and whosoever toucheth one that is slain with a sword in the open fields, or a dead body, or a bone of a man, or a grave, be stained-ceased seven days.and for an stained-ceased person they take of the ashes of the burnt heifer of bright-highness for miss, and running from-waters be put thereto in a tool:and a bright-climaxing person take hyssop-discharging, and dip it in the from-waters, and sprinkle it upon the tent, and upon all the tools, and upon the persons that were there, and upon him that touched a bone, or one slain, or one dead, or a grave:and the bright-climaxing person sprinkle upon the stained-ceased on the third day, and on the seventh day: and on the seventh day he purify himself, and wash his clothes, and bathe himself in from-waters, and be bright-climaxing at even.and the man that be stained-ceased, and not purify himself, that being be cut off from inward the until-witness, because he hath ceased the dedicated-finished of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah: the from-waters of separation hath not been sprinkled upon him; he is stained-ceased.and it be a perpetual statute unto them, that he that sprinkleth the from-waters of separation wash his clothes; and he that toucheth the from-waters of separation be stained-ceased until even.and whatsoever the stained-ceased person toucheth be stained-ceased; and the being that toucheth it be stained-ceased until even.then came children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards, even the whole until-witness, into the place-of-word-desert of zin-briar in the first month: and the with-mum-people abode in kadesh-dedicated-finished; and miriam-rebel-bitter died there, and was buried there.and there was no from-waters for the until-witness: and they added themselves together against mose-extracted and against aaron-cabinet.and the with-mum-people chode with mose-extracted, and spake, saying, would elohim-towards-these that we had died when our brethren died before-turns yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah!and why have ye brought up the until-witness of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah into this place-of-word-desert, that we and our in-them-animal should die there?and wherefore have ye made us to come up out of mizraim-narrows, to bring us in unto this bad place? it is no place of seed, or of figs, or of vines, or of high-pomegranates; neither is there any from-waters to drink.and mose-extracted and aaron-cabinet went from the presence of the assembly unto the opening of the tent of until-conception, and they fell upon their face-turns-turns: and the heaviness of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah appeared unto them.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah spake unto mose-extracted, saying,take the pen, and gather thou the assembly together, thou, and aaron-cabinet thy brother, and speak ye unto the rock before-turns their eyes; and it give forth his from-waters, and thou bring forth to them from-waters out of the rock: so thou give the until-witness and their beasts drink.and mose-extracted took the pen from before-turns yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, as he order-prescribed him.and mose-extracted and aaron-cabinet added the until-witness together before-turns the rock, and he said unto them, hear now, ye rebels; must we fetch you from-waters out of this rock?and mose-extracted lifted up his hand, and with his pen he smote the rock twice: and the from-waters came out abundantly, and the until-witness drank, and their beasts also.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah spake unto mose-extracted and aaron-cabinet, because ye was coached by me not, to dedicate-finify me in the eyes of children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards, therefore ye not bring this until-witness into the land which i have given them.this is the from-waters of meribah-jam; because children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards strove with yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, and he was dedicated-finished in them.and mose-extracted sent messengers from kadesh-dedicated-finished unto the moloch-king of edom-man, thus saith thy brother israel-saturated-towards, thou knowest all the travail that hath befallen us:how our fathers went down into mizraim-narrows, and we have dwelt in mizraim-narrows a long time; and the mizraim-narrowsians vexed us, and our fathers:and when we cried unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, he heard our voice, and sent an angel-messanger, and hath brought us forth out of mizraim-narrows: and, behold, we are in kadesh-dedicated-finished, a light-city in the uttermost of thy border:let us pass, i pray thee, through thy country: we will not pass through the fields, or through the vineyards, neither will we drink of the from-waters of the wells: we will go by the moloch-king's high way, we will not turn to the right hand nor to the left, until we have passed thy borders.and edom-man said unto him, no pass by me, lest i come out against thee with the sword.and children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards said unto him, we will go by the high way: and if i and my in-them-animal drink of thy from-waters, then i will pay for it: i will only, without doing anything else, go through on my feet.and he said, no go through. and edom-man came out against him with much with-mum-people, and with a strong hand.thus edom-man refused to give israel-saturated-towards passage through his border: wherefore israel-saturated-towards turned away from him.and children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards, even the whole until-witness, journeyed from kadesh-dedicated-finished, and came unto mount hor-mount.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah spake unto mose-extracted and aaron-cabinet in mount hor-mount, by the coast of the land of edom-man, saying,aaron-cabinet be added unto his with-mum-people: for he not enter into the land which i have given unto children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards, because ye rebelled against my bee-word at the from-waters of meribah-jam.take aaron-cabinet and eleazar-towards-stop his child-between, and bring them up unto mount hor-mount:and strip aaron-cabinet of his garments, and put them upon eleazar-towards-stop his child-between: and aaron-cabinet be added unto his with-mum-people, and die there.and mose-extracted did as yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah order-prescribed: and they went up into mount hor-mount in the sight of all the until-witness.and mose-extracted stripped aaron-cabinet of his garments, and put them upon eleazar-towards-stop his child-between; and aaron-cabinet died there in the head of the mount: and mose-extracted and eleazar-towards-stop came down from the mount.and when all the until-witness saw that aaron-cabinet was dead, they mourned for aaron-cabinet thirty days, even all the daughter-house of israel-saturated-towards.and when moloch-king arad-bronze the canaan-mobile-tradeite, which dwelt in the south-dry, heard tell that israel-saturated-towards came by the way of the spies; then he fought against israel-saturated-towards, and took some of them prisoners.and israel-saturated-towards vowed a vow unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, and said, if thou wilt indeed deliver this with-mum-people into my hand, then i will utterly destroy their cities.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah hearkened to the voice of israel-saturated-towards, and delivered up the canaan-mobile-tradeites; and they fishing-net-destroyed them and their cities: and he called the name of the place hormah-boycott-fishing-net.and they journeyed from mount hor-mount by the way of the end sea, to compass the land of edom-man: and the being of the with-mum-people was much discouraged because of the way.and the with-mum-people spake against elohim-towards-these, and against mose-extracted, wherefore have ye brought us up out of mizraim-narrows to die in the place-of-word-desert? for there is no bread, neither is there any from-waters; and our being loatheth this light bread.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah sent fiery serpents among the with-mum-people, and they bit the with-mum-people; and much with-mum-people of israel-saturated-towards died.therefore the with-mum-people came to mose-extracted, and said, we have missed, for we have bee-spoken against yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, and against thee; pray unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, that he take away the serpents from us. and mose-extracted prayed for the with-mum-people.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah said unto mose-extracted, make thee a fiery serpent, and set it upon a pole: and it come to pass, that every one that is bitten, when he looketh upon it, live.and mose-extracted made a serpent of brass, and put it upon a pole, and it came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he beheld the serpent of brass, he lived.and children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards set forward, and pitched in oboth-thick.and they journeyed from oboth-thick, and pitched at ijeabarim-heaps-crossings, in the place-of-word-desert which is before-turns moab-from-father, toward the sunrising.from thence they removed, and pitched in the valley of zared-twig.from thence they removed, and pitched on the other side of arnon-pine, which is in the place-of-word-desert that cometh out of the coasts of the amorite-talkers: for arnon-pine is the border of moab-from-father, between-bin moab-from-father and the amorite-talkers.wherefore it is said in the book of the wars of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, what he did in the end sea, and in the brooks of arnon-pine,and at the stream of the brooks that goeth down to the dwelling of ar-awake, and lieth upon the border of moab-from-father.and from thence they went to beer-well: that is the well whereof yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah spake unto mose-extracted, gather the with-mum-people together, and i will give them from-waters.then israel-saturated-towards sang this song, spring up, o well; sing ye unto it:the princes digged the well, the nobles of the with-mum-people digged it, by the direction of the teachinggiver, with their canvas. and from the place-of-word-desert they went to matenah-data-gift:and from matenah-data-gift to stream-towards-my: and from stream-towards-my to bamot-death-stage:and from bamot-death-stage in the valley, that is in the country of moab-from-father, to the top of pisgah-summit, which looketh toward jeshimon-will-apply.and israel-saturated-towards sent messengers unto sihon-curly moloch-king of the amorite-talkers, saying,let me pass through thy land: we will not turn into the fields, or into the vineyards; we will not drink of the from-waters of the well: and we will go along by the moloch-king's high way, until we be past thy borders.and sihon-curly would not suffer israel-saturated-towards to pass through his border: and sihon-curly added all his with-mum-people together, and went out against israel-saturated-towards into the place-of-word-desert: and he came to jahaz-stress, and fought against israel-saturated-towards.and israel-saturated-towards smote him with the edge of the sword, and possessed his land from arnon-pine unto jaboq-boxwood, even unto children-betweens of ammon-with: for the border of children-betweens of ammon-with was strong.and israel-saturated-towards took all these cities: and israel-saturated-towards dwelt in all the cities of the amorite-talkers, in heshbon-score, and in all the villages-daughters thereof.for heshbon-score was the light-city of sihon-curly the moloch-king of the amorite-talkers, who had fought against the former moloch-king of moab-from-father, and taken all his land out of his hand, even unto arnon-pine.wherefore they that speak in proverbs say, come into heshbon-score, let the light-city of sihon-curly be between-built and prepared:for there is a fire gone out of heshbon-score, a flame from the light-city of sihon-curly: it hath consumed ar-awake of moab-from-father, and the base-lords of the high places of arnon-pine.woe to thee, moab-from-father! thou art undone, o with-mum-people of chemosh: he hath given his children-betweens that escaped, and his children-betweenesss, into captivity unto sihon-curly moloch-king of the amorite-talkers.we have shot at them; heshbon-score is perished even unto dibon-slander, and we have laid them waste even unto nophah-volume, which reacheth unto medeba.thus israel-saturated-towards dwelt in the land of the amorite-talkers.and mose-extracted sent to spy out jaazer-help, and they took the villages thereof, and drove out the amorite-talkers that were there.and they turned and went up by the way of bashan-at-tooth: and og-mock the moloch-king of bashan-at-tooth went out against them, he, and all his with-mum-people, to the battle at edrei-live-prohibit.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah said unto mose-extracted, fear him not: for i have delivered him into thy hand, and all his with-mum-people, and his land; and thou do to him as thou didst unto sihon-curly moloch-king of the amorite-talkers, which dwelt at heshbon-score.so they smote him, and his children-betweens, and all his with-mum-people, until there was none left him alive: and they possessed his land.and children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards set forward, and pitched in the plains of moab-from-father on this side jordan-its-going-down by jericho-moon-smell.and balak-beat child-between of zipor-bird saw all that israel-saturated-towards had done to the amorite-talkers.and moab-from-father was sore afraid of the with-mum-people, because they were many: and moab-from-father was distressed because of children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards.and moab-from-father said unto the elders of midian-place-of-discussed-teaching, now this company lick up all that are round about us, as the wall-ox licketh up the grass of the field. and balak-beat child-between of zipor-bird was moloch-king of the moab-from-fatherites at that time.he sent messengers therefore unto baalam-swallow child-between of beor-in-the-skin to pethor, which is by the river of the land of children-betweens of his with-mum-people, to call him, saying, behold, there is a with-mum-people come out from mizraim-narrows: behold, they cover the face-turns of the earth, and they abide over against me:come now therefore, i pray thee, curse me this with-mum-people; for they are too mighty for me: peradventure i prevail, that we may hit them, and that i may drive them out of the land: for i wot that he whom thou knee-fluffy-blessest is knee-fluffy-blessed, and he whom thou cursest is cursed.and the elders of moab-from-father and the elders of midian-place-of-discussed-teaching departed with the rewards of divination in their hand; and they came unto baalam-swallow, and spake unto him the bee-words of balak-beat.and he said unto them, lodge here this night, and i will bring you bee-word again, as yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah speak unto me: and the princes of moab-from-father abode with baalam-swallow.and elohim-towards-these came unto baalam-swallow, and said, what men are these with thee?and baalam-swallow said unto elohim-towards-these, balak-beat child-between of zipor-bird, moloch-king of moab-from-father, hath sent unto me, saying,behold, there is a with-mum-people come out of mizraim-narrows, which covereth the face-turns of the earth: come now, curse me them; peradventure i be able to overcome them, and drive them out.and elohim-towards-these said unto baalam-swallow, no go with them; no curse the with-mum-people: for they are knee-fluffy-blessed.and baalam-swallow rose up in the morning, and said unto the princes of balak-beat, get you into your land: for yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah refuseth to give me leave to go with you.and the princes of moab-from-father rose up, and they went unto balak-beat, and said, baalam-swallow refuseth to come with us.and balak-beat sent yet again princes, more, and more honorable than they.and they came to baalam-swallow, and said to him, thus saith balak-beat child-between of zipor-bird, let nothing, i pray thee, here-hinder thee from coming unto me:for i will promote thee unto very great honor, and i will do whatsoever thou sayest unto me: come therefore, i pray thee, curse me this with-mum-people.and baalam-swallow answered and said unto the workers of balak-beat, if balak-beat would give me his daughter-house full of silver and gold, i cannot go beyond the bee-word of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah my elohim-towards-these, to do less or more.now therefore, i pray you, tarry ye also here this night, that i may hand-know what yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah will say unto me more.and elohim-towards-these came unto baalam-swallow at night, and said unto him, if the men come to call thee, rise up, and go with them; and yet the bee-word which i say unto thee, that thou do.and baalam-swallow rose up in the morning, and saddled his ass, and went with the princes of moab-from-father.and elohim-towards-these's nose-anger was kindled because he went: and the angel-messanger of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah stood in the way for an adversary-satan against him. now he was riding upon his ass, and his two workers were with him.and the ass saw the angel-messanger of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and the ass turned aside out of the way, and went into the field: and baalam-swallow smote the ass, to turn her into the way.and the angel-messanger of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah stood in a path of the vineyards, a wall being on this side, and a wall on that side.and when the ass saw the angel-messanger of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, she thrust herself unto the wall, and crushed baalam-swallow's foot against the wall: and he smote her again.and the angel-messanger of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah went further, and stood in a narrow place, where was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left.and when the ass saw the angel-messanger of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, she fell down under baalam-swallow: and baalam-swallow's nose-anger was kindled, and he smote the ass with a staff.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah opened the mouth of the ass, and she said unto baalam-swallow, what have i done unto thee, that thou hast smitten me these three times?and baalam-swallow said unto the ass, because thou hast mocked me: i would there were a sword in mine hand, for now would i kill thee.and the ass said unto baalam-swallow, am not i thine ass, upon which thou hast ridden ever since i was thine unto this day? was i ever wont to do so unto thee? and he said, nay.then yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah opened the eyes of baalam-swallow, and he saw the angel-messanger of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and he bowed down his head, and fell flat on his face-turns.and the angel-messanger of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah said unto him, wherefore hast thou smitten thine ass these three times? behold, i went out to withstand-satan thee, because thy way is perverse before-turns me:and the ass saw me, and turned from me these three times: unless she had turned from me, surely now also i had slain thee, and saved her alive.and baalam-swallow said unto the angel-messanger of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, i have missed; for i hand-knew not that thou stoodest in the way against me: now therefore, if it is bad in you eyes, i will get me back again.and the angel-messanger of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah said unto baalam-swallow, go with the men: and only the bee-word that i speak unto thee, that thou speak. so baalam-swallow went with the princes of balak-beat.and when balak-beat heard that baalam-swallow was come, he went out to until-witness him unto a light-city of moab-from-father, which is in the border of arnon-pine, which is in the utmost coast.and balak-beat said unto baalam-swallow, did i not earnestly send unto thee to call thee? wherefore camest thou not unto me? am i not able indeed to promote thee to honor?and baalam-swallow said unto balak-beat, lo, i am come unto thee: have i now any dynamic at all to say any thing? the bee-word that elohim-towards-these putteth in my mouth, that i speak.and baalam-swallow went with balak-beat, and they came unto kirjathuzot-district-of-midnight.and balak-beat butchered wall-oxen and flock, and sent to baalam-swallow, and to the princes that were with him.and it came to pass on the morrow, that balak-beat took baalam-swallow, and brought him up into the high places of baal-owner, that thence he might see the utmost part of the with-mum-people.and baalam-swallow said unto balak-beat, between-build me here seven butcher-kitchens, and prepare me here seven bulls and seven ram-voicelesss.and balak-beat did as baalam-swallow had bee-spoken; and balak-beat and baalam-swallow inwarded on every butcher-kitchen a bull and a ram-voiceless.and baalam-swallow said unto balak-beat, stand by thy on-up, and i will go: peradventure yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah will come to meet me: and whatsoever he showeth me i will tell thee. and he went to an high place.and elohim-towards-these met baalam-swallow: and he said unto him, i have prepared seven butcher-kitchens, and i have inwarded upon every butcher-kitchen a bull and a ram-voiceless.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah put a bee-word in baalam-swallow's mouth, and said, return unto balak-beat, and thus thou speak.and he returned unto him, and, lo, he stood by his on-up, he, and all the princes of moab-from-father.and he took up his parable, and said, balak-beat the moloch-king of moab-from-father hath brought me from aram-high, out of the mountains of the east, saying, come, curse me jacob-backstreet, and come, defy israel-saturated-towards.how i curse, whom elohim-towards-these hath not cursed? or how i defy, whom yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah hath not defied?for from the top of the rocks i see him, and from the hills i behold him: lo, the with-mum-people dwell alone, and not be reckoned among the nations.who can count the dust of jacob-backstreet, and the number of the fourth part of israel-saturated-towards? let me die the death of the just, and let my last end be like his!and balak-beat said unto baalam-swallow, what hast thou done unto me? i took thee to curse mine father-adversaries, and, behold, thou hast knee-fluffy-blessed them altogether.and he answered and said, must i not take heed to speak that which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah hath put in my mouth?and balak-beat said unto him, come, i pray thee, with me unto another place, from whence thou mayest see them: thou see and the utmost part of them, and not see them all: and curse me them from thence.and he brought him into the field of zophim-floats, to the top of pisgah-summit, and between-built seven butcher-kitchens, and inwarded a bull and a ram-voiceless on every butcher-kitchen.and he said unto balak-beat, stand here by thy on-up, while i until-witness yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah yonder.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah met baalam-swallow, and put a bee-word in his mouth, and said, go again unto balak-beat, and say thus.and when he came to him, behold, he stood by his on-up, and the princes of moab-from-father with him. and balak-beat said unto him, what hath yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah bee-spoken?and he took up his parable, and said, rise up, balak-beat, and hear; hearken unto me, thou child-between of zipor-bird:elohim-towards-these is not a man, that he should lie; neither child-between of man, that he should repent: hath he said, and he not do it? or hath he bee-spoken, and he not make it good?behold, i have received order-prescription to knee-fluffy-bless: and he hath knee-fluffy-blessed; and i cannot reverse it.he hath not beheld torment in jacob-backstreet, neither hath he seen perverseness in israel-saturated-towards: yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah his elohim-towards-these is with him, and the shout of a moloch-king is among them.elohim-towards-these brought them out of mizraim-narrows; he hath as it were the strength of an unicorn.surely there is no enchantment against jacob-backstreet, neither is there any divination against israel-saturated-towards: according to this time it be said of jacob-backstreet and of israel-saturated-towards, what hath elohim-towards-these wrought!behold, the with-mum-people rise up as a gather-lion, and lift up himself as a gather-lion: he not lie down until he eat of the prey, and drink the blood of the slain.and balak-beat said unto baalam-swallow, neither curse them at all, nor knee-fluffy-bless them at all.and baalam-swallow answered and said unto balak-beat, told not i thee, saying, all that yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah speaketh, that i must do?and balak-beat said unto baalam-swallow, come, i pray thee, i will bring thee unto another place; peradventure it will please elohim-towards-these that thou mayest curse me them from thence.and balak-beat brought baalam-swallow unto the top of peor, that looketh toward jeshimon-will-apply.and baalam-swallow said unto balak-beat, between-build me here seven butcher-kitchens, and prepare me here seven bulls and seven ram-voicelesss.and balak-beat did as baalam-swallow had said, and inwarded a bull and a ram-voiceless on every butcher-kitchen.and when baalam-swallow saw that it was good in the eyes of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah to knee-fluffy-bless israel-saturated-towards, he went not, as at other times, to seek for enchantments, and he set his face-turns toward the place-of-word-desert.and baalam-swallow lifted up his eyes, and he saw israel-saturated-towards abiding in his tents according to their branchs; and breath-spirit of elohim-towards-these came upon him.and he took up his parable, and said, baalam-swallow child-between of beor-in-the-skin hath said, and the man whose eyes are open hath said:he hath said, which heard the bee-words of elohim-towards-these, which saw the vision of the almighty, falling into a trance, and having his eyes open:how goodly are thy tents, o jacob-backstreet, and thy dwellings, o israel-saturated-towards!as the valleys are they spread forth, as gardens by the river's side, as the trees of lign aloes which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah hath planted, and as cedar trees beside the from-waters.he pour the from-waters out of his buckets, and his seed be in many from-waters, and his moloch-king be higher than agag-roof, and his moloch-kingdom be exalted.elohim-towards-these brought him forth out of mizraim-narrows; he hath as it were the strength of an unicorn: he eat up the nations his father-adversaries, and break their bones, and pierce them through with his arrows.he couched, he lay down as a gather-lion, and as a gather-lion: who stir him up? knee-fluffy-blessed is he that knee-fluffy-blesseth thee, and cursed is he that curseth thee.and balak-beat's nose-anger was kindled against baalam-swallow, and he smote his hands together: and balak-beat said unto baalam-swallow, i called thee to curse mine father-adversaries, and, behold, thou hast altogether knee-fluffy-blessed them these three times.therefore now flee thou to thy place: i thought to promote thee unto great honor; and, lo, yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah hath kept thee back from honor.and baalam-swallow said unto balak-beat, spake i not also to thy messengers which thou sentest unto me, saying,if balak-beat would give me his daughter-house full of silver and gold, i cannot go beyond the order-prescription of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, to do either good or bad of mine own mind; and what yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah saith, that will i speak?and now, behold, i go unto my with-mum-people: come therefore, and i will advertise thee what this with-mum-people do to thy with-mum-people in the latter days.and he took up his parable, and said, baalam-swallow child-between of beor-in-the-skin hath said, and the man whose eyes are open hath said:he hath said, which heard the bee-words of elohim-towards-these, and hand-knew the knowledge of the most high, which saw the vision of the almighty, falling into a trance, and having his eyes open:i see him, and not now: i behold him, and not nigh: there come a star out of jacob-backstreet, and a sceptre rise out of israel-saturated-towards, and hit the corners of moab-from-father, and destroy all children-betweens of sheth-drink-put.and edom-man be a possession, seir-hair-style also be a possession for his father-adversaries; and israel-saturated-towards do valiantly.out of jacob-backstreet come he that have dominion, and destroy him that remaineth of the light-city.and when he looked on amalek-labour-moloch-king, he took up his parable, and said, amalek-labour-moloch-king was the first of the nations; and his latter end be that he perish for ever.and he looked on the kenite-nests-nest, and took up his parable, and said, strong is thy dwelling place, and thou puttest thy nest in a rock.nevertheless the kenite-nest be wasted, until asshur-beech carry thee away captive.and he took up his parable, and said, alas, who live when elohim-towards-these doeth this!and ships come from the coast of chitim-stains, and afflict asshur-beech, and afflict eber-pass, and he also perish for ever.and baalam-swallow rose up, and went and returned to his place: and balak-beat also went his way.and israel-saturated-towards abode in shitim-sailing, and the with-mum-people began to prostitute with children-betweenesss of moab-from-father.and they called the with-mum-people unto the butchers of their elohim-towards-these: and the with-mum-people did eat, and bowed down to their elohim-towards-these.and israel-saturated-towards joined himself unto baalpeor-own-wide-open: and the nose-anger of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah was kindled against israel-saturated-towards.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah said unto mose-extracted, take all the heads of the with-mum-people, and hang them up before-turns yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah against the sun, that the fierce nose-anger of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah may be turned away from israel-saturated-towards.and mose-extracted said unto the decides of israel-saturated-towards, slay ye every one his men that were joined unto baalpeor-own-wide-open.and, behold, one of children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards came and inwarded unto his brethren a midian-place-of-discussed-teachingitish woman in the sight of mose-extracted, and in the sight of all the until-witness of children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards, who were weeping before-turns the opening of the tent of until-conception.and when pinehas-mouth-attempt, child-between of eleazar-towards-stop, child-between of aaron-cabinet the dimmer-server, saw it, he rose up from inward the until-witness, and took a javelin in his hand;and he went after the man of israel-saturated-towards into the tent, and thrust both of them through, the man of israel-saturated-towards, and the woman through her nurture-belly. so the plague was stayed from children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards.and those that died in the plague were double-ten-twenty and four thousand.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah spake unto mose-extracted, saying,pinehas-mouth-attempt, child-between of eleazar-towards-stop, child-between of aaron-cabinet the dimmer-server, hath turned my wrath away from children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards, while he was zealous for my sake among them, that i consumed not children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards in my jealousy.wherefore say, behold, i give unto him my covenant of peace:and he have it, and his seed after him, even the covenant of an everlasting dimmer-serverhood;

he not break his bee-word, he do according to all that proceedeth out of his mouth.if a woman also vow a vow unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, and bind herself by a bond, being in her father's daughter-house in her youth;and her father hear her vow, and her bond wherewith she hath bound her being, and her father hold his peace at her; then all her vows stand, and every bond wherewith she hath bound her being stand.and if her father disallow her in the day that he heareth; not any of her vows, or of her bonds wherewith she hath bound her being, stand: and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah forgive her, because her father disallowed her.and if she had at all an man, when she vowed, or uttered ought out of her lips, wherewith she bound her being;and her man heard it, and held his peace at her in the day that he heard it: then her vows stand, and her bonds wherewith she bound her being stand.and if her man disallowed her on the day that he heard it; then he make her vow which she vowed, and that which she uttered with her lips, wherewith she bound her being, of none effect: and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah forgive her.and every vow of a widow, and of her that is divorced, wherewith they have bound their beings, stand against her.and if she vowed in her man's daughter-house, or bound her being by a bond with an toward-oath;and her man heard it, and held his peace at her, and disallowed her not: then all her vows stand, and every bond wherewith she bound her being stand.and if her man hath utterly made them void on the day he heard them; then whatsoever proceeded out of her lips concerning her vows, or concerning the bond of her being, not stand: her man hath made them void; and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah forgive her.every vow, and every binding toward-oath to afflict the being, her man may establish it, or her man may make it void.and if her man altogether hold his peace at her from day to day; then he establisheth all her vows, or all her bonds, which are upon her: he confirmeth them, because he held his peace at her in the day that he heard them.and if he any ways make them void after that he hath heard them; then he bear her torment.these are the statutes, which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah order-prescribed mose-extracted, between-bin a man and his woman, between-bin the father and his daughter-hoof-bat-child, being yet in her youth in her father's daughter-house.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah spake unto mose-extracted, saying,avenge children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards of the midian-place-of-discussed-teachingites: afterward thou be added unto thy with-mum-people.and mose-extracted spake unto the with-mum-people, saying, arm some of yourselves unto the troop-cluster, and let them go against the midian-place-of-discussed-teachingites, and avenge yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah of midian-place-of-discussed-teaching.of every branch a thousand, throughout all the branchs of israel-saturated-towards, ye send to the troop-cluster.so there were delivered out of the thousands of israel-saturated-towards, a thousand of every branch, twelve thousand armed for troop-cluster.and mose-extracted sent them to the troop-cluster, a thousand of every branch, them and pinehas-mouth-attempt child-between of eleazar-towards-stop the dimmer-server, to the troop-cluster, with the dedicated-finished instruments, and the mouthpiece-trumpets to blow in his hand.and they troop-clusterred against the midian-place-of-discussed-teachingites, as yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah order-prescribed mose-extracted; and they slew all the rememberers.and they slew the moloch-kings of midian-place-of-discussed-teaching, beside the rest of them that were slain; namely, evi-my-desire, and rekem-weave, and zur-flint, and hur-small-place-prince, and reba-one-fourth-great-grandson, five moloch-kings of midian-place-of-discussed-teaching: baalam-swallow also child-between of beor-in-the-skin they slew with the sword.and children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards took all the women of midian-place-of-discussed-teaching captives, and their little ones, and took the spoil of all their in-them-animal, and all their flocks, and all their goods.and they burnt all their cities wherein they dwelt, and all their goodly castles, with fire.and they took all the spoil, and all the prey, both of men and of beasts.and they brought the captives, and the prey, and the spoil, unto mose-extracted, and eleazar-towards-stop the dimmer-server, and unto the until-witness of children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards, unto the camp at the plains of moab-from-father, which are by jordan-its-going-down near jericho-moon-smell.and mose-extracted, and eleazar-towards-stop the dimmer-server, and all the princes of the until-witness, went forth to until-witness them without the camp.and mose-extracted was wroth with the officers of the troop-cluster, with the captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, which came from the battle.and mose-extracted said unto them, have ye saved all the women alive?behold, these caused children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards, through the counsel of baalam-swallow, to commit fire-name to yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah in the matter of peor, and there was a plague among the until-witness of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah.now therefore kill every rememberer among the little ones, and kill every woman that hath hand-known man by lying with him.and all the women children-betweens, that have not hand-known a man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves.and do ye abide without the camp seven days: whosoever hath killed any person, and whosoever hath touched any slain, purify both yourselves and your captives on the third day, and on the seventh day.and purify all your raiment, and all that is made of light-skins, and all work of intense-goats' gate-hair, and all things made of wood.and eleazar-towards-stop the dimmer-server said unto the men of troop-cluster which went to the battle, this is the ordinance of the teaching which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah order-prescribed mose-extracted;only the gold, and the silver, the brass, the iron, the tin, and the lead,every thing that may abide the fire, ye make it go through the fire, and it be bright-climaxing: nevertheless it be purified with the from-waters of separation: and all that abideth not the fire ye make go through the from-waters.and ye wash your clothes on the seventh day, and ye be bright-climaxing, and afterward ye come into the camp.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah spake unto mose-extracted, saying,take the sum of the prey that was taken, both of man and of beast, thou, and eleazar-towards-stop the dimmer-server, and the chief fathers of the until-witness:and divide the prey into two parts; between-bin them that took the war upon them, who went out to battle, and between-bin all the until-witness:and levy a tribute unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah of the men of troop-cluster which went out to battle: one being of five hundred, both of the persons, and of the beeves, and of the asses, and of the sheep:take it of their half, and give it unto eleazar-towards-stop the dimmer-server, for an raise-rum of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah.and of children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards's half, thou take one portion of fifty, of the beings of man, of the beeves, of the asses, and of the flocks, of all manner of beasts, and give them unto the levi-jointes, which keep the charge of the dwelling of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah.and mose-extracted and eleazar-towards-stop the dimmer-server did as yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah order-prescribed mose-extracted.and the booty, being the rest of the prey which the men of troop-cluster had caught, was six hundred thousand and seventy thousand and five thousand sheep,and threescore and twelve thousand beeves,and threescore and one thousand asses,and thirty and two thousand beings of man in all, of women that had not hand-known remember-man by lying with him.and the half, which was the portion of them that went out to troop-cluster, was in number three hundred thousand and seven and thirty thousand and five hundred sheep:and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah's tribute of the sheep was six hundred and threescore and fifteen.and the beeves were thirty and six thousand; of which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah's tribute was threescore and twelve.and the asses were thirty thousand and five hundred; of which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah's tribute was threescore and one.and the beings of man were sixteen thousand; of which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah's tribute was thirty and two beings of man.and mose-extracted gave the tribute, which was yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah's raise-rum, unto eleazar-towards-stop the dimmer-server, as yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah order-prescribed mose-extracted.and of children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards's half, which mose-extracted divided from the men that troop-clusterred,(now the half that pertained unto the until-witness was three hundred thousand and thirty thousand and seven thousand and five hundred sheep,and thirty and six thousand beeves,and thirty thousand asses and five hundred,and sixteen thousand beings of man;)even of children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards's half, mose-extracted took one portion of fifty, both of man and of beast, and gave them unto the levi-jointes, which kept the charge of the dwelling of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah; as yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah order-prescribed mose-extracted.and the officers which were over thousands of the troop-cluster, the prince-soakeds of thousands, and prince-soakeds of hundreds, came near unto mose-extracted:and they said unto mose-extracted, thy workers have taken the sum of the men of war which are under our charge, and there lacketh not one man of us.we have therefore brought an inward for yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, what every man hath gotten, of jewels of gold, chains, and bracelets, rings, earrings, and tablets, to make an out-of-town-ment for our beings before-turns yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah.and mose-extracted and eleazar-towards-stop the dimmer-server took the gold of them, even all wrought jewels.and all the gold of the inward that they inwarded up to yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, of the captains of thousands, and of the captains of hundreds, was sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekel-lights.(for the men of war had taken spoil, every man for himself.)and mose-extracted and eleazar-towards-stop the dimmer-server took the gold of the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and brought it into the tent of until-conception, for a memorial for children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards before-turns yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah.now children-betweens of reu-buddyben and children-betweens of gad-luck had a very great multitude of in-them-animal: and when they saw the land of jazer, and the land of gilead-roll-until-heap, that, behold, the place was a place for in-them-animal;children-betweens of gad-luck and children-betweens of reu-buddyben came and spake unto mose-extracted, and to eleazar-towards-stop the dimmer-server, and unto the princes of the until-witness, saying,atarot-decorate-crown, and dibon-slander, and jazer, and nimrah, and heshbon-score, and eleale-top-to-no, and sheba-comingm, and nebo-at-him, and beon,even the country which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah smote before-turns the until-witness of israel-saturated-towards, is a land for in-them-animal, and thy workers have in-them-animal:wherefore, said they, if we have found attractiveness in thy sight, let this land be given unto thy workers for a possession, and bring us not over jordan-its-going-down.and mose-extracted said unto children-betweens of gad-luck and to children-betweens of reu-buddyben, your brethren go to war, and ye sit here?and wherefore discourage ye the heart of children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards from going over into the land which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah hath given them?thus did your fathers, when i sent them from kadeshbarnea-finished-desert-staggering to see the land.for when they went up unto the valley of eshcol-fire-all, and saw the land, they discouraged the heart of children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards, that they should not go into the land which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah had given them.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah's nose-anger was kindled the same time, and he sware, saying,surely none of the men that came up out of mizraim-narrows, from double-ten-twenty years old and upward, see the land which i sware unto abraham-their-dick, unto isaac-laughter, and unto jacob-backstreet; because they have not wholly followed me:save caleb-as-heart-dog child-between of jephuneh-turn the kenezite, and jesus-save-joshua child-between of nun-fish: for they have wholly followed yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah's nose-anger was kindled against israel-saturated-towards, and he made them wander in the place-of-word-desert forty years, until all the generation, that had done bad in the sight of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, was consumed.and, behold, ye are risen up in your fathers' stead, an increase of missing men, to augment yet the fierce nose-anger of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah toward israel-saturated-towards.for if ye turn away from after him, he will yet again leave them in the place-of-word-desert; and ye destroy all this with-mum-people.and they came near unto him, and said, we will between-build sheepfolds here for our in-them-animal, and cities for our little ones:and we ourselves will go ready armed before-turns children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards, until we have brought them unto their place: and our little ones dwell in the fenced cities because of the inhabitants of the land.we will not return unto our daughter-houses, until children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards have inherited every man his inheritance.for we will not inherit with them on yonder side jordan-its-going-down, or forward; because our inheritance is fallen to us on this side jordan-its-going-down eastward.and mose-extracted said unto them, if ye will do this thing, if ye will go armed before-turns yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah to war,and will go all of you pioneering over jordan-its-going-down before-turns yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, until he hath driven out his father-adversaries from before-turns him,and the land be lambed before-turns yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah: then afterward ye return, and be guiltless before-turns yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, and before-turns israel-saturated-towards; and this land be your possession before-turns yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah.and if ye will not do so, behold, ye have missed to yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah: and be sure your miss will find you out.between-build you cities for your little ones, and folds for your sheep; and do that which hath proceeded out of your mouth.and children-betweens of gad-luck and children-betweens of reu-buddyben spake unto mose-extracted, saying, thy workers will do as my base-lord order-prescribeeth.our little ones, our women, our flocks, and all our in-them-animal, be there in the cities of gilead-roll-until-heap:and thy workers will pass over, every man armed for war, before-turns the base-lord to battle, as my base-lord saith.so concerning them mose-extracted order-prescribed eleazar-towards-stop the dimmer-server, and jesus-save-joshua child-between of nun-fish, and the chief fathers of the branchs of children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards:and mose-extracted said unto them, if children-betweens of gad-luck and children-betweens of reu-buddyben will pass with you over jordan-its-going-down, every man armed to battle, before-turns yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, and the land be subdued before-turns you; then ye give them the land of gilead-roll-until-heap for a possession:and if they will not pass over with you pioneering, they have possessions among you in the land of canaan-mobile-trade.and children-betweens of gad-luck and children-betweens of reu-buddyben answered, saying, as yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah hath said unto thy workers, so will we do.we will pass over pioneering before-turns yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah into the land of canaan-mobile-trade, that the possession of our inheritance on this side jordan-its-going-down may be ours.and mose-extracted gave unto them, even to children-betweens of gad-luck, and to children-betweens of reu-buddyben, and unto half the branch of manasseh-place-of-sleep child-between of joseph-add, the moloch-kingdom of sihon-curly moloch-king of the amorite-talkers, and the moloch-kingdom of og-mock moloch-king of bashan-at-tooth, the land, with the cities thereof in the coasts, even the cities of the country round about.and children-betweens of gad-luck between-built dibon-slander, and atarot-decorate-crown, and aroer-juniper-object,and atrot-decorate-crown, shophan-rabbit, and jaazer-help, and jogbehah-rise,and betnimrah-house-of-leopardess, and betharan-house-of-sing, fenced cities: and folds for sheep.and children-betweens of reu-buddyben between-built heshbon-score, and eleale-top-to-no, and kirjatim-towns,and nebo-at-him, and baalmeon-residence-of-baal-owner, (their names being changed,) and shibmah-stage: and gave other names unto the cities which they between-between-builded.and children-betweens of machi-of-beatr-recognize child-between of manasseh-place-of-sleep went to gilead-roll-until-heap, and took it, and dispossessed the amorite-talker which was in it.and mose-extracted gave gilead-roll-until-heap unto machi-of-beatr-recognize child-between of manasseh-place-of-sleep; and he dwelt therein.and jair-glow child-between of manasseh-place-of-sleep went and took the small towns thereof, and called them havotjair-farm-of-glow.and nobah-bark-abuse went and took kenat-elegy, and the villages thereof, and called it nobah-bark-abuse, after his own name.these are the journeys of children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards, which went forth out of the land of mizraim-narrows with their troop-clusters under the hand of mose-extracted and aaron-cabinet.and mose-extracted wrote their goings out according to their journeys by the order-prescription of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah: and these are their journeys according to their goings out.and they departed from ram-voicelessses-born-by-ra in the first month, on the fifteenth day of the first month; on the morrow after the passover children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards went out with an high hand in the sight of all the mizraim-narrowsians.for the mizraim-narrowsians buried all their firstborn, which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah had smitten among them: upon their elohim-towards-these also yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah executed decision-grammars.and children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards removed from ram-voicelessses-born-by-ra, and pitched in succoth-booths.and they departed from succoth-booths, and pitched in etam-you, which is in the edge of the place-of-word-desert.and they removed from etam-you, and turned again unto pihahirot-mouth-of-the-choice, which is before-turns baalzephon-owner-of-cipher: and they pitched before-turns migdol-tower.and they departed from before-turns pihahirot-mouth-of-the-choice, and passed through the midst of the sea into the place-of-word-desert, and went three days' journey in the place-of-word-desert of etam-you, and pitched in marah-bitter.and they removed from marah-bitter, and came unto elim-bind: and in elim-bind were twelve fountains of from-waters, and threescore and ten palm trees; and they pitched there.and they removed from elim-bind, and encamped by the end sea.and they removed from the end sea, and encamped in the place-of-word-desert of miss.and they took their journey out of the place-of-word-desert of miss, and encamped in dophkah-knock.and they departed from dophkah-knock, and encamped in alush-knead.and they removed from alush-knead, and encamped at rephidim-upholstery, where was no from-waters for the with-mum-people to drink.and they departed from rephidim-upholstery, and pitched in the place-of-word-desert of )sinai-bush-(proto.and they removed from the place-of-word-desert of bush-missai, and pitched at hatavah-graveyard-of-craving-kibrot.and they departed from hatavah-graveyard-of-craving-kibrot, and encamped at hazerot-gardens.and they departed from hazerot-gardens, and pitched in ritmah-harness.and they departed from ritmah-harness, and pitched at rimonparez-pomegranate-breach.and they departed from rimonparez-pomegranate-breach, and pitched in libnah-white-build.and they removed from libnah-white-build, and pitched at risah-her-eyelash.and they journeyed from risah-her-eyelash, and pitched in kelelatah-her-congregation.and they went from kelelatah-her-congregation, and pitched in mount shapher-boost-bull.and they removed from mount shapher-boost-bull, and encamped in haradah-anxiety.and they removed from haradah-anxiety, and pitched in makheloth-of-community.and they removed from makheloth-of-community, and encamped at tahat-under.and they departed from tahat-under, and pitched at tarah-effort.and they removed from tarah-effort, and pitched in mitcah-sweetening.and they went from mitcah-sweetening, and pitched in hashmonah-eight-rain.and they departed from hashmonah-eight-rain, and encamped at moseroth-deliveries.and they departed from moseroth-deliveries, and pitched in benejaakan-between-children-of-corner.and they removed from benejaakan-between-children-of-corner, and encamped at tickle-the.and they went from tickle-the, and pitched in jotbatah-her-fourth-month.and they removed from jotbatah-her-fourth-month, and encamped at ebronah-pass-traverse.and they departed from ebronah-pass-traverse, and encamped at eziongaber-wood-strong-man.and they removed from eziongaber-wood-strong-man, and pitched in the place-of-word-desert of zin-briar, which is kadesh-dedicated-finished.and they removed from kadesh-dedicated-finished, and pitched in mount hor-mount, in the edge of the land of edom-man.and aaron-cabinet the dimmer-server went up into mount hor-mount at the order-prescription of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, and died there, in the fortieth year after children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards were come out of the land of mizraim-narrows, in the first day of the fifth month.and aaron-cabinet was an hundred and double-ten-twenty and three years old when he died in mount hor-mount.and moloch-king arad-bronze the canaan-mobile-tradeite, which dwelt in the south-dry in the land of canaan-mobile-trade, heard of the coming of children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards.and they departed from mount hor-mount, and pitched in zalmonah-image-idol.and they departed from zalmonah-image-idol, and pitched in punon-found.and they departed from punon-found, and pitched in oboth-thick.and they departed from oboth-thick, and pitched in ijeabarim-heaps-crossings, in the border of moab-from-father.and they departed from iim-islands, and pitched in dibon-slandergad.and they removed from dibon-slandergad, and encamped in diblataim-the-hidden-fig-cakes-almon.and they removed from diblataim-the-hidden-fig-cakes-almon, and pitched in the mountains of abarim-crossings-over, before-turns nebo-at-him.and they departed from the mountains of abarim-crossings-over, and pitched in the plains of moab-from-father by jordan-its-going-down near jericho-moon-smell.and they pitched by jordan-its-going-down, from betjesimot-desolate-house even unto abel-vaporshittim in the plains of moab-from-father.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah spake unto mose-extracted in the plains of moab-from-father by jordan-its-going-down near jericho-moon-smell, saying,speak unto children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards, and say unto them, when ye are passed over jordan-its-going-down into the land of canaan-mobile-trade;then ye drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before-turns you, and destroy all their pictures, and destroy all their images, and quite pluck down all their high places:and ye dispossess the inhabitants of the land, and dwell therein: for i have given you the land to possess it.and ye divide the land by lot-cover for an inheritance among your families: and to the more ye give the more inheritance, and to the fewer ye give the less inheritance: every man's inheritance be in the place where his lot falleth; according to the branchs of your fathers ye inherit.and if ye will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before-turns you; then it come to pass, that those which ye let remain of them be pricks in your eyes, and thorns in your sides, and vex you in the land wherein ye dwell.moreover it come to pass, that i do unto you, as i thought to do unto them.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah spake unto mose-extracted, saying,order-prescribe children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards, and say unto them, when ye come into the land of canaan-mobile-trade; (this is the land that fall unto you for an inheritance, even the land of canaan-mobile-trade with the coasts thereof:)then your south-dry quarter be from the place-of-word-desert of zin-briar along by the coast of edom-man, and your south-dry border be the outmost coast of the salt sea eastward:and your border turn from the south-dry to the ascent of akrabim-scorpions, and pass on to zin-briar: and the going forth thereof be from the south-dry to kadeshbarnea-finished-desert-staggering, and go on to adar-garden-maple-hazar, and pass on to azmon-skeleton:and the border fetch a compass from azmon-skeleton unto the river of mizraim-narrows, and the goings out of it be at the sea.and as for the sea-western border, ye even have the great sea for a border: this be your sea-west border.and this be your hide-north border: from the great sea ye point out for you mount hor-mount:from mount hor-mount ye point out your border unto the entrance of ham-hotath; and the goings forth of the border be to zedad-flank:and the border go on to ziphron-sweet-smell, and the goings out of it be at hazarenan-garden-eye: this be your hide-north border.and ye point out your east border from hazarenan-garden-eye to shepham-moustache:and the coast go down from shepham-moustache to riblah-fight, on the east side of ain-eye; and the border descend, and reach unto the side of the sea of kineret-like-candle eastward:and the border go down to jordan-its-going-down, and the goings out of it be at the salt sea: this be your land with the coasts thereof round about.and mose-extracted order-prescribed children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards, saying, this is the land which ye inherit by lot, which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah order-prescribed to give unto the nine branchs, and to the half branch:for the branch of children-betweens of reu-buddyben according to the daughter-house of their fathers, and the branch of children-betweens of gad-luck according to the daughter-house of their fathers, have received their inheritance; and half the branch of manasseh-place-of-sleep have received their inheritance:the two branchs and the half branch have received their inheritance on this side jordan-its-going-down near jericho-moon-smell eastward, toward the sunrising.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah spake unto mose-extracted, saying,these are the names of the men which divide the land unto you: eleazar-towards-stop the dimmer-server, and jesus-save-joshua child-between of nun-fish.and ye take one prince of every branch, to divide the land by inheritance.and the names of the men are these: of the branch of judah-know, caleb-as-heart-dog child-between of jephuneh-turn.and of the branch of children-betweens of simeon-hear-home, shemuel child-between of amihud-with-my-glory.of the branch of benjamin-he-between-of-righthand, elidad-my-towards-breast child-between of chislon-fool-basket.and the branch of children-betweens of dan-discuss, buki-skilled child-between of jogli-my-roll.the prince of children-betweens of joseph-add, for the branch of children-betweens of manasseh-place-of-sleep, haniel-grace-towards child-between of ephod-cash-in.and the branch of children-betweens of ephraim-fruitful, kemuel-get-up-towards child-between of shiphtan-lip.and the branch of children-betweens of zebulun-fertile, elizaphan child-between of parnach-bull.and the branch of children-betweens of issachar-wage, palti-emitel child-between of azan-goat-courage.and the branch of children-betweens of asher-bliss, ahihud child-between of shelomi-my-peace.and the branch of children-betweens of naphtali-twisted, pedahel-redemption-towards child-between of amihud-with-my-glory.these are they whom yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah order-prescribed to divide the inheritance unto children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards in the land of canaan-mobile-trade.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah spake unto mose-extracted in the plains of moab-from-father by jordan-its-going-down near jericho-moon-smell, saying,order-prescribe children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards, that they give unto the levi-jointes of the inheritance of their possession cities to dwell in; and ye give also unto the levi-jointes plots for the cities round about them.and the cities they have to dwell in; and the plots of them be for their in-them-animal, and for their goods, and for all their beasts.and the plots of the cities, which ye give unto the levi-jointes, reach from the wall of the light-city and outward a thousand cubits round about.and ye measure from without the light-city on the east side two thousand cubits, and on the south-dry side two thousand cubits, and on the sea-west side two thousand cubits, and on the hide-north side two thousand cubits; and the light-city be in the midst: this be to them the plots of the cities.and among the cities which ye give unto the levi-jointes there be six cities for refuge, which ye appoint for the manslayer, that he may flee thither: and to them ye add forty and two cities.so all the cities which ye give to the levi-jointes be forty and eight cities: them ye give with their plots.and the cities which ye give be of the possession of children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards: from them that have many ye give many; and from them that have few ye give few: every one give of his cities unto the levi-jointes according to his inheritance which he inheriteth.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah spake unto mose-extracted, saying,speak unto children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards, and say unto them, when ye be come over jordan-its-going-down into the land of canaan-mobile-trade;then ye appoint you cities to be cities of refuge for you; that the slayer may flee thither, which killeth any person at unawares.and they be unto you cities for refuge from the avenger; that the manslayer die not, until he stand before-turns the until-witness in decision-grammar.and of these cities which ye give six cities ye have for refuge.ye give three cities on this side jordan-its-going-down, and three cities ye give in the land of canaan-mobile-trade, which be cities of refuge.these six cities be a refuge, both for children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards, and for the stranger, and for the sojourner among them: that every one that killeth any person unawares may flee thither.and if he hit him with an instrument of iron, so that he die, he is a murderer: the murderer surely be put to death.and if he hit him with throwing a father-child-stone, wherewith he may die, and he die, he is a murderer: the murderer surely be put to death.or if he hit him with an hand weapon of wood, wherewith he may die, and he die, he is a murderer: the murderer surely be put to death.the revenger of blood himself slay the murderer: when he until-witnesseth him, he slay him.and if he thrust him of hatred, or hurl at him by laying of wait, that he die;or in enmity hit him with his hand, that he die: he that smote him surely be put to death; for he is a murderer: the revenger of blood slay the murderer, when he until-witnesseth him.and if he thrust him suddenly without enmity, or have cast upon him any thing without laying of wait,or with any father-child-stone, wherewith a man may die, seeing him not, and cast it upon him, that he die, and was not his enemy, neither sought his harm:then the until-witness decide between-bin the slayer and the revenger of blood according to these decision-grammars:and the until-witness deliver the slayer out of the hand of the revenger of blood, and the until-witness restore him to the light-city of his refuge, whither he was fled: and he abide in it unto the death of the high dimmer-server, which was lubeed with the dedicated-finished name-from-oil.and if the slayer at any time come without the border of the light-city of his refuge, whither he was fled;and the revenger of blood find him without the borders of the light-city of his refuge, and the revenger of blood kill the slayer; he not be guilty of blood:because he should have remained in the light-city of his refuge until the death of the high dimmer-server: and after the death of the high dimmer-server the slayer return into the land of his possession.so these things be for a statute of decision-grammar unto you throughout your generations in all your dwellings.whoso killeth any person, the murderer be put to death by the mouth of witnesses: and one witness not testify against any person to cause him to die.moreover ye take no satisfaction for the life of a murderer, which is fire-name of death: and he be deadly put to death.and ye take no satisfaction for him that is fled to the light-city of his refuge, that he should come again to dwell in the land, until the death of the dimmer-server.so ye not pollute the land wherein ye are: for blood it ceaseth the land: and the land cannot be bright-climaxingsed of the blood that is shed therein, and by the blood of him that shed it.cease not therefore the land which ye inhabit, wherein i dwell: for i yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah dwell among children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards.and the chief fathers of the families of children-betweens of gilead-roll-until-heap, child-between of machi-of-beatr-recognize, child-between of manasseh-place-of-sleep, of the families of children-betweens of joseph-add, came near, and spake before-turns mose-extracted, and before-turns the leaders, the chief fathers of children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards:and they said, yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah order-prescribed my base-lord to give the land for an inheritance by lot to children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards: and my base-lord was order-prescribed by yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah to give the inheritance of zelophehad-whip-sharp our brother unto his children-betweenesss.and if they be married to any of children-betweens of the other branchs of children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards, then their inheritance be taken from the inheritance of our fathers, and be put to the inheritance of the branch whereunto they are received: so it be taken from the lot of our inheritance.and when the river-jubilee of children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards be, then their inheritance be put unto the inheritance of the branch whereunto they are received: so their inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of the branch of our fathers.and mose-extracted order-prescribed children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards according to the bee-word of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, saying, the branch of children-betweens of joseph-add hath said well.this is the thing which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah doth order-prescribe concerning children-betweenesss of zelophehad-whip-sharp, saying, let them marry to whom they think best; only to the family of the branch of their father they marry.so not the inheritance of children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards remove from branch to branch: for every one of children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards keep himself to the inheritance of the branch of his fathers.and every daughter-hoof-bat-child, that possesseth an inheritance in any branch of children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards, be woman unto one of the family of the branch of her father, that children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards may enjoy every man the inheritance of his fathers.neither the inheritance remove from one branch to another branch; and every one of the branchs of children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards keep himself to his own inheritance.even as yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah order-prescribed mose-extracted, so did children-betweenesss of zelophehad-whip-sharp:for mahlah-illness, tirzah-want-placate-solve, and hoglah-partridge, and milcah-queen, and noah-rest, children-betweenesss of zelophehad-whip-sharp, were married unto their father's brothers' children-betweens:and they were married into the families of children-betweens of manasseh-place-of-sleep child-between of joseph-add, and their inheritance remained in the branch of the family of their father.these are the order-prescriptions and the decision-grammars, which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah order-prescribed by the hand of mose-extracted unto children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards in the plains of moab-from-father by jordan-its-going-down near jericho-moon-smell.these be the bee-words which mose-extracted spake unto all israel-saturated-towards on this side jordan-its-going-down in the place-of-word-desert, in the plain over against the end sea, between-bin paran-magnificence, and tophel-bland, and laban-white, and hazerot-gardens, and dizahab-enough-gold.(there are eleven days' journey from horeb-sword by the way of mount seir-hair-style unto kadeshbarnea-finished-desert-staggering.)and it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first day of the month, that mose-extracted spake unto children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards, according unto all that yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah had given him in order-prescription unto them;after he had slain sihon-curly the moloch-king of the amorite-talkers, which dwelt in heshbon-score, and og-mock the moloch-king of bashan-at-tooth, which dwelt at astarot-you-gave-fire in edrei-live-prohibit:on this side jordan-its-going-down, in the land of moab-from-father, began mose-extracted to declare this teaching, saying,yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah our elohim-towards-these spake unto us in horeb-sword, saying, ye have dwelt long enough in this mount:turn you, and take your journey, and go to the mount of the amorite-talkers, and unto all the places nigh thereunto, in the plain, in the hills, and in the vale, and in the south-dry, and by the sea side, to the land of the canaan-mobile-tradeites, and unto lebanon-build-white, unto the great river, the river euphrates-cow.behold, i have set the land before-turns you: go in and possess the land which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah sware unto your fathers, abraham-their-dick, isaac-laughter, and jacob-backstreet, to give unto them and to their seed after them.and i spake unto you at that time, saying, i am not able to bear you myself alone:yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah your elohim-towards-these hath multiplied you, and, behold, ye are this day as the stars of namespaces for multitude.(yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah elohim-towards-these of your fathers make you a thousand times so many more as ye are, and knee-fluffy-bless you, as he hath promised you!)how can i myself alone bear your cumbrance, and your burden, and your strife?take you wise men, and understanding, and hand-known among your branchs, and i will make them rulers over you.and ye answered me, and said, the thing which thou hast bee-spoken is good for us to do.so i took the chief of your branchs, wise men, and hand-known, and made them heads over you, captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, and captains over fifties, and captains over tens, and officers among your branchs.and i charged your decides at that time, saying, hear the causes between-bin your brethren, and decide justly between-bin every man and his brother, and the stranger that is with him.ye not respect persons in decision-grammar; and ye hear the small as well as the great; ye not be afraid of the face-turns of man; for the decision-grammar is elohim-towards-these's: and the cause that is too hard for you, bring it unto me, and i will hear it.and i order-prescribed you at that time all the things which ye should do.and when we departed from horeb-sword, we went through all that great and terrible place-of-word-desert, which ye saw by the way of the mountain of the amorite-talkers, as yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah our elohim-towards-these order-prescribed us; and we came to kadeshbarnea-finished-desert-staggering.and i said unto you, ye are come unto the mountain of the amorite-talkers, which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah our elohim-towards-these doth give unto us.behold, yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these hath set the land before-turns thee: go up and possess it, as yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah elohim-towards-these of thy fathers hath said unto thee; fear not, neither be discouraged.and ye came near unto me every one of you, and said, we will send men before-turns us, and they search us out the land, and bring us bee-word again by what way we must go up, and into what cities we come.and the saying pleased me well: and i took twelve men of you, one of a branch:and they turned and went up into the mountain, and came unto the valley of eshcol-fire-all, and searched it out.and they took of the fruit of the land in their hands, and brought it down unto us, and brought us bee-word again, and said, it is a good land which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah our elohim-towards-these doth give us.notwithstanding ye would not go up, and rebelled against the order-prescription of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah your elohim-towards-these:and ye murmured in your tents, and said, because yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah hated us, he hath brought us forth out of the land of mizraim-narrows, to deliver us into the hand of the amorite-talkers, to destroy us.whither we go up? our brethren have discouraged our heart, saying, the with-mum-people is greater and taller than we; the cities are great and walled up to namespaces; and moreover we have seen children-betweens of the anak-giantims there.then i said unto you, dread not, neither be afraid of them.yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah your elohim-towards-these which goeth before-turns you, he fight for you, according to all that he did for you in mizraim-narrows before-turns your eyes;and in the place-of-word-desert, where thou hast seen how that yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these conceived-of thee, as a man doth bear his child-between, in all the way that ye went, until ye came into this place.yet in this thing ye did not be coached by yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah your elohim-towards-these,who went in the way before-turns you, to search you out a place to pitch your tents in, in fire by night, to show you by what way ye should go, and in a cloud by day.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah heard the voice of your bee-words, and was wroth, and sware, saying,surely there not one of these men of this bad generation see that good land, which i sware to give unto your fathers.save caleb-as-heart-dog child-between of jephuneh-turn; he see it, and to him will i give the land that he hath trodden upon, and to his children-betweens, because he hath wholly followed yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah.also yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah was angry with me for your sakes, saying, thou also not go in thither.and jesus-save-joshua child-between of nun-fish, which standeth before-turns thee, he go in thither: encourage him: for he cause israel-saturated-towards to inherit it.moreover your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, and your children-betweens, which in that day had no knowledge between-bin good and bad, they go in thither, and unto them will i give it, and they possess it.and as for you, turn you, and take your journey into the place-of-word-desert by the way of the end sea.then ye answered and said unto me, we have missed to yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, we will go up and fight, according to all that yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah our elohim-towards-these order-prescribed us. and when ye had girded on every man his weapons of war, ye were ready to go up into the hill.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah said unto me, say unto them. go not up, neither fight; for i am not among you; lest ye be smitten before-turns your father-adversaries.so i spake unto you; and ye would not hear, and rebelled against the order-prescription of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, and went presumptuously up into the hill.and the amorite-talkers, which dwelt in that mountain, came out against you, and chased you, as bees do, and destroyed you in seir-hair-style, even unto hormah-boycott-fishing-net.and ye returned and wept before-turns yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah; and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah would not hearken to your voice, nor give ear unto you.so ye abode in kadesh-dedicated-finished many days, according unto the days that ye abode there.then we turned, and took our journey into the place-of-word-desert by the way of the end sea, as yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah spake unto me: and we compassed mount seir-hair-style many days.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah spake unto me, saying,ye have compassed this mountain long enough: turn you hide-northward.and order-prescribe thou the with-mum-people, saying, ye are to pass through the coast of your brethren children-betweens of esau-do, which dwell in seir-hair-style; and they be afraid of you: take ye good heed unto yourselves therefore:meddle not with them; for i will not give you of their land, no, not so much as a foot breadth; because i have given mount seir-hair-style unto esau-do for a possession.ye buy meat of them for money, that ye may eat; and ye also buy from-waters of them for money, that ye may drink.for yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these hath knee-fluffy-blessed thee in all the works of thy hand: he knoweth thy walking through this great place-of-word-desert: these forty years yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these hath been with thee; thou hast lacked nothing.and when we passed by from our brethren children-betweens of esau-do, which dwelt in seir-hair-style, through the way of the plain from elath, and from eziongaber-wood-strong-man, we turned and passed by the way of the place-of-word-desert of moab-from-father.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah said unto me, distress not the moab-from-fatherites, neither contend with them in battle: for i will not give thee of their land for a possession; because i have given ar-awake unto children-betweens of lot-cover for a possession.the emims dwelt therein in times past, a with-mum-people great, and many, and tall, as the anak-giantims;which also were accounted giants, as the anak-giantims; and the moab-from-fatherites called them emims.the hori-my-holems also dwelt in seir-hair-style beforetime; and children-betweens of esau-do succeeded them, when they had destroyed them from before-turns them, and dwelt in their stead; as israel-saturated-towards did unto the land of his possession, which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah gave unto them.now rise up, said i, and get you over the brook zered-twig. and we went over the brook zered-twig.and the space in which we came from kadeshbarnea-finished-desert-staggering, until we were come over the brook zered-twig, was thirty and eight years; until all the generation of the men of war were wasted out from inward the troop-cluster, as yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah sware unto them.for indeed the hand of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah was against them, to destroy them from inward the troop-cluster, until they were consumed.so it came to pass, when all the men of war were consumed and dead from inward the with-mum-people,that yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah spake unto me, saying,thou art to pass over through ar-awake, the coast of moab-from-father, this day:and when thou comest nigh over against children-betweens of ammon-with, distress them not, nor meddle with them: for i will not give thee of the land of children-betweens of ammon-with any possession; because i have given it unto children-betweens of lot-cover for a possession.(that also was accounted a land of giants: giants dwelt therein in old time; and the ammon-withites call them zamzumim-buzzers;a with-mum-people great, and many, and tall, as the anak-giantims; and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah destroyed them before-turns them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead:as he did to children-betweens of esau-do, which dwelt in seir-hair-style, when he destroyed the hori-my-holems from before-turns them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead even unto this day:and the avims-awful which dwelt in hazerim-premises, even unto azah-goat-courage, the caphtor-button-solvedim-buttonss, which came forth out of caphtor-button-solved, destroyed them, and dwelt in their stead.)rise ye up, take your journey, and pass over the river arnon-pine: behold, i have given into thine hand sihon-curly the amorite-talker, moloch-king of heshbon-score, and his land: begin to possess it, and contend with him in battle.this day will i begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of thee upon the nations that are under the whole namespaces, who hear report of thee, and tremble, and be in anguish because of thee.and i sent messengers out of the place-of-word-desert of kedemoth unto sihon-curly moloch-king of heshbon-score with bee-words of peace, saying,let me pass through thy land: i will go along by the high way, i will neither turn unto the right hand nor to the left.thou sell me meat for money, that i may eat; and give me from-waters for money, that i may drink: only i will pass through on my feet;(as children-betweens of esau-do which dwell in seir-hair-style, and the moab-from-fatherites which dwell in ar-awake, did unto me;) until i pass over jordan-its-going-down into the land which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah our elohim-towards-these giveth us.and sihon-curly moloch-king of heshbon-score would not let us pass by him: for yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these hardened his breath-spirit, and made his heart obstinate, that he might deliver him into thy hand, as appeareth this day.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah said unto me, behold, i have begun to give sihon-curly and his land before-turns thee: begin to possess, that thou mayest inherit his land.then sihon-curly came out against us, he and all his with-mum-people, to fight at jahaz-stress.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah our elohim-towards-these delivered him before-turns us; and we smote him, and his children-betweens, and all his with-mum-people.and we took all his cities at that time, and fishing-net-destroyed the men, and the women, and the little ones, of every light-city, we left none to remain:only the in-them-animal we took for a prey unto ourselves, and the spoil of the cities which we took.from aroer-juniper-object, which is by the brink of the river of arnon-pine, and from the light-city that is by the river, even unto gilead-roll-until-heap, there was not one light-city too strong for us: yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah our elohim-towards-these delivered all unto us:only unto the land of children-betweens of ammon-with thou camest not, nor unto any place of the river jaboq-boxwood, nor unto the cities in the mountains, nor unto whatsoever yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah our elohim-towards-these forbade us.then we turned, and went up the way to bashan-at-tooth: and og-mock the moloch-king of bashan-at-tooth came out against us, he and all his with-mum-people, to battle at edrei-live-prohibit.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah said unto me, fear him not: for i will deliver him, and all his with-mum-people, and his land, into thy hand; and thou do unto him as thou didst unto sihon-curly moloch-king of the amorite-talkers, which dwelt at heshbon-score.so yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah our elohim-towards-these delivered into our hands og-mock also, the moloch-king of bashan-at-tooth, and all his with-mum-people: and we smote him until none was left to him remaining.and we took all his cities at that time, there was not a city which we took not from them, threescore cities, all the region of argob-lump, the moloch-kingdom of og-mock in bashan-at-tooth.all these cities were fenced with high walls, hair-gates, and bars; beside unwalled towns a great many.and we fishing-net-destroyed them, as we did unto sihon-curly moloch-king of heshbon-score, utterly destroying the men, women, and children-betweens, of every light-city.and all the in-them-animal, and the spoil of the cities, we took for a prey to ourselves.and we took at that time out of the hand of the two moloch-kings of the amorite-talkers the land that was on this side jordan-its-going-down, from the river of arnon-pine unto mount hermon-fishing-net;(which hermon-fishing-net the sidon-side-by-sideians call sirion-armor-plate; and the amorite-talkers call it meadow-tooth;)all the cities of the plain, and all gilead-roll-until-heap, and all bashan-at-tooth, unto salchah-poor and edrei-live-prohibit, cities of the moloch-kingdom of og-mock in bashan-at-tooth.for only og-mock moloch-king of bashan-at-tooth remained of the remnant of giants; behold his bedstead was a bedstead of iron; is it not in rabat-much of children-betweens of ammon-with? nine cubits was the length thereof, and four cubits the breadth of it, after the cubit of a man.and this land, which we possessed at that time, from aroer-juniper-object, which is by the river arnon-pine, and half mount gilead-roll-until-heap, and the cities thereof, gave i unto the reu-buddybenites and to the gad-luckites.and the rest of gilead-roll-until-heap, and all bashan-at-tooth, being the moloch-kingdom of og-mock, gave i unto the half branch of manasseh-place-of-sleep; all the region of argob-lump, with all bashan-at-tooth, which was called the land of giants.jair-glow child-between of manasseh-place-of-sleep took all the country of argob-lump unto the coasts of geshuri and maachathi; and called them after his own name, jair-at-tooth-ranches-shine-bashan-havot, unto this day.and i gave gilead-roll-until-heap unto machi-of-beatr-recognize.and unto the reu-buddybenites and unto the gad-luckites i gave from gilead-roll-until-heap even unto the river arnon-pine half the valley, and the border even unto the river jaboq-boxwood, which is the border of children-betweens of ammon-with;the plain also, and jordan-its-going-down, and the coast thereof, from kineret-like-candle even unto the sea of the plain, even the salt sea, under peak-fire-being right eastward.and i order-prescribed you at that time, saying, yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah your elohim-towards-these hath given you this land to possess it: ye pass over armed before-turns your brethren children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards, all that are until-witness for the war.and your women, and your little ones, and your in-them-animal, (for i hand-know that ye have much in-them-animal,) abide in your cities which i have given you;until yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah have given rest unto your brethren, as well as unto you, and until they also possess the land which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah your elohim-towards-these hath given them beyond jordan-its-going-down: and then ye return every man unto his possession, which i have given you.and i order-prescribed jesus-save-joshua at that time, saying, thine eyes have seen all that yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah your elohim-towards-these hath done unto these two moloch-kings: so yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah do unto all the moloch-kingdoms whither thou passest.ye not fear them: for yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah your elohim-towards-these he fight for you.and i besought yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah at that time, saying,o base-lord elohim-towards-these, thou hast begun to show thy worker thy greatness, and thy mighty hand: for what elohim-towards-these is there in namespaces or in earth, that can do according to thy works, and according to thy might?i pray thee, let me go over, and see the good land that is beyond jordan-its-going-down, that goodly mountain, and lebanon-build-white.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah was wroth with me for your sakes, and would not hear me: and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah said unto me, let it suffice thee; speak no more unto me of this matter.get thee up into the top of pisgah-summit, and lift up thine eyes sea-westward, and hide-northward, and south-dryward, and eastward, and behold it with thine eyes: for no go over this jordan-its-going-down.and charge jesus-save-joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him: for he go over before-turns this with-mum-people, and he cause them to inherit the land which thou see.so we abode in the valley over against betpeor-house-gaping.now therefore hearken, o israel-saturated-towards, unto the statutes and unto the decision-grammars, which i teach you, for to do them, that ye may live, and go in and possess the land which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah elohim-towards-these of your fathers giveth you.ye not add unto the bee-word which i order-prescribe you, neither ye diminish ought from it, that ye may keep the order-prescriptions of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah your elohim-towards-these which i order-prescribe you.your eyes have seen what yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah did because of baalpeor-own-wide-open: for all the men that followed baalpeor-own-wide-open, yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these hath destroyed them from inward you.and ye that did cleave unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah your elohim-towards-these are alive every one of you this day.behold, i have taught you statutes and decision-grammars, even as yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah my elohim-towards-these order-prescribed me, that ye should do so in the land whither ye go to possess it.keep therefore and do them; for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the nations, which hear all these statutes, and say, surely this great nation is a wise and understanding with-mum-people.for what nation is there so great, who hath elohim-towards-these so nigh unto them, as yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah our elohim-towards-these is in all things that we call upon him for?and what nation is there so great, that hath statutes and decision-grammars so just as all this teaching, which i set before-turns you this day?only take heed to thyself, and keep thy being diligently, lest thou forget the things which thine eyes have seen, and lest they depart from thy heart all the days of thy life: and teach them thy children-betweens, and thy children-betweens' children-betweens;specially the day that thou stoodest before-turns yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these in horeb-sword, when yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah said unto me, gather me the with-mum-people together, and i will make them hear my bee-words, that they may learn to fear me all the days that they live upon the earth, and that they may teach their children-betweens.and ye came near and stood under the mountain; and the mountain burned with fire unto the midst of namespaces, with darkness, clouds, and thick darkness.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah spake unto you out of the midst of the fire: ye heard the voice of the bee-words, and saw no similitude; only ye heard a voice.and he declared unto you his covenant, which he order-prescribed you to perform, even ten order-prescriptions; and he wrote them upon two tables of father-child-stone.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah order-prescribed me at that time to teach you statutes and decision-grammars, that ye might do them in the land whither ye go over to possess it.take ye therefore good heed unto yourselves; for ye saw no manner of similitude on the day that yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah spake unto you in horeb-sword out of the midst of the fire:lest ye corrupt yourselves, and make you a graven image, the similitude of any figure, the likeness of rememberer or pierced,the likeness of any beast that is on the earth, the likeness of any winged fowl that flieth in the air,the likeness of any thing that creepeth on the ground, the likeness of any fish that is in the from-waters beneath the earth:and lest thou lift up thine eyes unto namespaces, and when thou seest the sun, and the moon, and the stars, even all the troop-cluster of namespaces, shouldest be driven to partake-shatakh them, and work for them, which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these hath divided unto all nations under the whole namespaces.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah hath taken you, and brought you forth out of the iron furnace, even out of mizraim-narrows, to be unto him a with-mum-people of inheritance, as ye are this day.furthermore yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah was angry with me for your sakes, and sware that i should not go over jordan-its-going-down, and that i should not go in unto that good land, which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these giveth thee for an inheritance:and i must die in this land, i must not go over jordan-its-going-down: and ye go over, and possess that good land.take heed unto yourselves, lest ye forget the covenant of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah your elohim-towards-these, which he made with you, and make you a graven image, or the likeness of any thing, which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these hath forbidden thee.for yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these is a consuming fire, even a jealous elohim-towards-these.when thou beget children-betweens, and children-betweens's children-betweens, and ye have remained long in the land, and corrupt yourselves, and make a graven image, or the likeness of any thing, and do bad in the sight of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these, to provoke him to nose-anger:i call namespaces and earth to witness against you this day, that ye soon utterly perish from off the land whereunto ye go over jordan-its-going-down to possess it; ye not prolong your days upon it, and utterly be destroyed.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah scatter you among the nations, and ye be left few in number among the nations, whither yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah lead you.and there ye work for elohim-towards-these, the work of men's hands, wood and father-child-stone, which neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell.and if from thence thou seek yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these, thou find him, if thou seek him with all thy heart and with all thy being.when thou art in tribulation, and all these things are come upon thee, even in the latter days, if thou turn to yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these, and be hearing unto his voice;(for yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these is a merciful elohim-towards-these;) he will not forsake thee, neither destroy thee, nor forget the covenant of thy fathers which he sware unto them.for ask now of the days that are past, which were before-turns thee, since the day that elohim-towards-these created man upon the earth, and ask from the one side of namespaces unto the other, whether there hath been any such thing as this great thing is, or hath been heard like it?did ever with-mum-people hear the voice of elohim-towards-these speaking out of the midst of the fire, as thou hast heard, and live?or hath elohim-towards-these assayed to go and take him a nation from the midst of another nation, by temptations, by signs, and by wonders, and by war, and by a mighty hand, and by a stretched out arm, and by great terrors, according to all that yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah your elohim-towards-these did for you in mizraim-narrows before-turns your eyes?unto thee it was showed, that thou mightest hand-know that yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah he is elohim-towards-these; there is none else beside him.out of namespaces he made thee to hear his voice, that he might instruct thee: and upon earth he showed thee his great fire; and thou heardest his bee-words out of the midst of the fire.and because he loved thy fathers, therefore he chose their seed after them, and brought thee out in his sight with his mighty dynamic out of mizraim-narrows;to drive out nations from before-turns thee greater and mightier than thou art, to bring thee in, to give thee their land for an inheritance, as it is this day.hand-know therefore this day, and consider it in thine heart, that yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah he is elohim-towards-these in namespaces above, and upon the earth beneath: there is none else.thou keep therefore his statutes, and his order-prescriptions, which i order-prescribe thee this day, that it may go well with thee, and with thy children-betweens after thee, and that thou mayest prolong thy days upon the earth, which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these giveth thee, all days.then mose-extracted severed three cities on this side jordan-its-going-down toward the sunrising;that the slayer might flee thither, which should kill his neighbor unawares, and hated him not in times past; and that fleeing unto one of these cities he might live:namely, bezer-ore in the place-of-word-desert, in the plain country, of the reu-buddybenites; and ram-voicelessoth in gilead-roll-until-heap, of the gad-luckites; and golan-wave-reveal in bashan-at-tooth, of the manassites-place-of-sleep.and this is the teaching which mose-extracted set before-turns children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards:these are the testimonies, and the statutes, and the decision-grammars, which mose-extracted spake unto children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards, after they came forth out of mizraim-narrows.on this side jordan-its-going-down, in the valley over against betpeor-house-gaping, in the land of sihon-curly moloch-king of the amorite-talkers, who dwelt at heshbon-score, whom mose-extracted and children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards smote, after they were come forth out of mizraim-narrows:and they possessed his land, and the land of og-mock moloch-king of bashan-at-tooth, two moloch-kings of the amorite-talkers, which were on this side jordan-its-going-down toward the sunrising;from aroer-juniper-object, which is by the bank of the river arnon-pine, even unto mount sion-zenith, which is hermon-fishing-net,and all the plain on this side jordan-its-going-down eastward, even unto the sea of the plain, under the springs of pisgah-summit.and mose-extracted called all israel-saturated-towards, and said unto them, hear, o israel-saturated-towards, the statutes and decision-grammars which i speak in your ears this day, that ye may learn them, and keep, and do them.yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah our elohim-towards-these made a covenant with us in horeb-sword.yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah made not this covenant with our fathers, and with us, even us, who are all of us here alive this day.yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah talked with you face-turns to face-turns in the mount out of the midst of the fire,(i stood between-bin yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah and you at that time, to show you the bee-word of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah: for ye were afraid by reason of the fire, and went not up into the mount;) saying,i am yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these, which brought thee out of the land of mizraim-narrows, from the daughter-house of bondage.thou have none other elohim-towards-these before-turns me.no make thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in namespaces above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the from-waters beneath the earth:no bow down thyself unto them, nor work for them: for i yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these am a jealous elohim-towards-these, visiting the torment of the fathers upon children-betweens unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me,and showing mercy unto thousands of them that love me and keep my order-prescriptions.no take the name of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these in vain: for yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.keep the sabbath-seven day to dedicate-finify it, as yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these hath order-prescribed thee.six days thou labor, and do all thy work:and the seventh day is the sabbath-seven of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these: in it no do any work, thou, nor thy child-between, nor thy daughter-hoof-bat-child, nor thy worker, nor thy mum-true-maid, nor thine wall-ox, nor thine ass, nor any of thy in-them-animal, nor thy stranger that is within thy hair-gates; that thy worker and thy mum-true-maid may rest as well as thou.and remember that thou wast a worker in the land of mizraim-narrows, and that yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these brought thee out thence through a mighty hand and by a stretched out arm: therefore yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these order-prescribed thee to keep the sabbath-seven day.give weight to thy father and thy mother, as yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these hath order-prescribed thee; that thy days may be prolonged, and that it may go well with thee, in the land which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these giveth thee.no kill.neither thou commit adultery.neither thou steal.neither thou bear false witness against thy neighbor.neither thou desire thy neighbor's woman, neither thou covet thy neighbor's daughter-house, his field, or his worker, or his mum-true-maid, his wall-ox, or his ass, or any thing that is thy neighbor's.these bee-words yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah spake unto all your assembly in the mount out of the midst of the fire, of the cloud, and of the thick darkness, with a great voice: and he added no more. and he wrote them in two tables of father-child-stone, and delivered them unto me.and it came to pass, when ye heard the voice out of the midst of the darkness, (for the mountain did burn with fire,) that ye came near unto me, even all the heads of your branchs, and your elders;and ye said, behold, yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah our elohim-towards-these hath showed us his heaviness and his greatness, and we have heard his voice out of the midst of the fire: we have seen this day that elohim-towards-these doth talk with man, and he liveth.now therefore why should we die? for this great fire will consume us: if we hear the voice of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah our elohim-towards-these any more, then we die.for who is there of all flesh, that hath heard the voice of the living elohim-towards-these speaking out of the midst of the fire, as we have, and lived?go thou near, and hear all that yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah our elohim-towards-these say: and speak thou unto us all that yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah our elohim-towards-these speak unto thee; and we will hear it, and do it.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah heard the voice of your bee-words, when ye spake unto me; and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah said unto me, i have heard the voice of the bee-words of this with-mum-people, which they have bee-spoken unto thee: they have well said all that they have bee-spoken.o that there were such an heart in them, that they would fear me, and keep all my order-prescriptions always, that it might be well with them, and with their children-betweens for ever!go say to them, get you into your tents again.and as for thee, stand thou here by me, and i will speak unto thee all the order-prescriptions, and the statutes, and the decision-grammars, which thou teach them, that they may do them in the land which i give them to possess it.ye guard-observe to do therefore as yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah your elohim-towards-these hath order-prescribed you: ye not turn aside to the right hand or to the left.ye walk in all the ways which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah your elohim-towards-these hath order-prescribed you, that ye may live, and that it may be well with you, and that ye may prolong your days in the land which ye possess.now these are the order-prescriptions, the statutes, and the decision-grammars, which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah your elohim-towards-these order-prescribed to teach you, that ye might do them in the land whither ye go to possess it:that thou mightest fear yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these, to keep all his statutes and his order-prescriptions, which i order-prescribe thee, thou, and thy child-between, and thy child-between's child-between, all the days of thy life; and that thy days may be prolonged.hear therefore, o israel-saturated-towards, and guard-observe to do it; that it may be well with thee, and that ye may increase mightily, as yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah elohim-towards-these of thy fathers hath promised thee, in the land that floweth with milk and honey.hear, o israel-saturated-towards: yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah our elohim-towards-these is one yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah:and thou love yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these with all thine heart, and with all thy being, and with all thy might.and these bee-words, which i order-prescribe thee this day, be in thine heart:and thou teach them diligently unto thy children-betweens, and talk of them when thou sittest in thine daughter-house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.and thou bind them for a sign upon thine hand, and they be as frontlets between-bin thine eyes.and thou write them upon the posts of thy daughter-house, and on thy hair-gates.and it be, when yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these have brought thee into the land which he sware unto thy fathers, to abraham-their-dick, to isaac-laughter, and to jacob-backstreet, to give thee great and goodly cities, which thou between-between-buildedst not,and daughter-houses full of all good things, which thou filledst not, and wells digged, which thou diggedst not, vineyards and olive trees, which thou plantedst not; when thou have eaten and be full;then beware lest thou forget yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, which brought thee forth out of the land of mizraim-narrows, from the daughter-house of bondage.thou fear yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these, and work for him, and swear by his name.ye not go after other elohim-towards-these, of the elohim-towards-these of the with-mum-people which are round about you;(for yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these is a jealous elohim-towards-these among you) lest the nose-anger of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these be kindled against thee, and destroy thee from off the face-turns of the earth.ye not tempt yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah your elohim-towards-these, as ye tempted him in massa-loadh.ye diligently keep the order-prescriptions of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah your elohim-towards-these, and his testimonies, and his statutes, which he hath order-prescribed thee.and thou do that which is right and good in the sight of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah: that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest go in and possess the good land which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah sware unto thy fathers.to cast out all thine father-adversaries from before-turns thee, as yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah hath bee-spoken.and when thy child-between asketh thee in time to come, saying, what mean the testimonies, and the statutes, and the decision-grammars, which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah our elohim-towards-these hath order-prescribed you?then thou say unto thy child-between, we were pharaoh-big-house's workers in mizraim-narrows; and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah brought us out of mizraim-narrows with a mighty hand:and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah showed signs and wonders, great and sore, upon mizraim-narrows, upon pharaoh-big-house, and upon all his daughter-household, before-turns our eyes:and he brought us out from thence, that he might bring us in, to give us the land which he sware unto our fathers.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah order-prescribed us to do all these statutes, to fear yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah our elohim-towards-these, for our good always, that he might preserve us alive, as it is at this day.and it be our being right, if we guard-observe to do all these order-prescriptions before-turns yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah our elohim-towards-these, as he hath order-prescribed us.when yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these bring thee into the land whither thou goest to possess it, and hath cast out many nations before-turns thee, the hittite-cuts-tusk, and the girgashites-emotional, and the amorite-talkers, and the canaan-mobile-tradeites, and the perizzite-unwalleds, and the hivite-experiences, and the jebusite-tramplers, seven nations greater and mightier than thou;and when yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these deliver them before-turns thee; thou hit them, and utterly destroy them; thou make no covenant with them, nor show mercy unto them:neither thou make marriages with them; thy daughter-hoof-bat-child no give unto his child-between, nor his daughter-hoof-bat-child thou take unto thy child-between.for they will turn away thy child-between from following me, that they may work for other elohim-towards-these: so will the nose-anger of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah be kindled against you, and destroy thee suddenly.and thus ye deal with them; ye destroy their butcher-kitchens, and break down their images, and cut down their groves, and burn their graven images with fire.for thou art an dedicated-finished with-mum-people unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these: yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these hath chosen thee to be a special with-mum-people unto himself, above all with-mum-people that are upon the face-turns of the earth.yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah did not set his love upon you, nor choose you, because ye were more in number than any with-mum-people; for ye were the fewest of all with-mum-people:and because yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah loved you, and because he would keep the toward-oath which he had sworn unto your fathers, hath yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah brought you out with a mighty hand, and redeemed you out of the daughter-house of workers, from the hand of pharaoh-big-house moloch-king of mizraim-narrows.hand-know therefore that yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these, he is elohim-towards-these, the faith-trainingful elohim-towards-these, which keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love him and keep his order-prescriptions to a thousand generations;and repayeth them that hate him to their face-turns, to destroy them: he will not be slack to him that hateth him, he will repay him to his face-turns.thou therefore keep the order-prescriptions, and the statutes, and the decision-grammars, which i order-prescribe thee this day, to do them.wherefore it come to pass, if ye hearken to these decision-grammars, and keep, and do them, that yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these keep unto thee the covenant and the mercy which he sware unto thy fathers:and he will love thee, and knee-fluffy-bless thee, and multiply thee: he will also knee-fluffy-bless the fruit of thy womb, and the fruit of thy land, thy corn-swimming, and thy wine-inherit, and thine name-from-oil, the increase of thy kine, and the flocks of thy sheep, in the land which he sware unto thy fathers to give thee.thou be knee-fluffy-blessed above all with-mum-people: there not be rememberer or pierced barren among you, or among your in-them-animal.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah will take away from thee all sickness, and will put none of the bad diseases of mizraim-narrows, which thou knowest, upon thee; and will lay them upon all them that hate thee.and thou consume all the with-mum-people which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these deliver thee; thine eye have no pity upon them: neither thou work for their elohim-towards-these; for that will be a snare unto thee.if thou say in thine heart, these nations are more than i; how can i dispossess them?no be afraid of them: and well remember what yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these did unto pharaoh-big-house, and unto all mizraim-narrows;the great temptations which thine eyes saw, and the signs, and the wonders, and the mighty hand, and the stretched out arm, whereby yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these brought thee out: so yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these do unto all the with-mum-people of whom thou art afraid.moreover yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these will send the wasp among them, until they that are left, and hide themselves from thee, be destroyed.no be affrighted at them: for yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these is among you, a mighty elohim-towards-these and terrible.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these will put out those nations before-turns thee by little and little: thou mayest not consume them at once, lest the beasts of the field increase upon thee.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these deliver them unto thee, and destroy them with a mighty destruction, until they be destroyed.and he deliver their moloch-kings into thine hand, and thou destroy their name from under namespaces: there no man be able to stand before-turns thee, until thou have destroyed them.the graven images of their elohim-towards-these ye burn with fire: no desire the silver or gold that is on them, nor take it unto thee, lest thou be snared therein: for it is an abomination to yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these.neither thou bring an abomination into thine daughter-house, lest thou be a cursed thing like it: and thou utterly detest it, and thou utterly crave-abhor it; for it is a cursed thing.all the order-prescriptions which i order-prescribe thee this day ye guard-observe to do, that ye may live, and multiply, and go in and possess the land which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah sware unto your fathers.and thou remember all the way which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these led thee these forty years in the place-of-word-desert, to humble thee, and to prove thee, to hand-know what was in thine heart, whether thou wouldest keep his order-prescriptions, or no.and he humbled thee, and suffered thee to hunger, and fed thee with manna-whats-that, which thou hand-knewest not, neither did thy fathers hand-know; that he might make thee hand-know that man doth not live by bread only, and by every bee-word that proceedeth out of the mouth of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah doth man live.thy raiment waxed not old upon thee, neither did thy foot swell, these forty years.thou also consider in thine heart, that, as a man chasteneth his child-between, so yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these chasteneth thee.therefore thou keep the order-prescriptions of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these, to walk in his ways, and to fear him.for yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these bringeth thee into a good land, a land of brooks of from-waters, of fountains and depths that spring out of valleys and hills;a land of wheat, and gates-barley, and vines, and fig trees, and high-pomegranates; a land of name-from-oil olive, and honey;a land wherein thou eat bread without scarceness, no lack any thing in it; a land whose stones are iron, and out of whose hills thou mayest dig brass.when thou hast eaten and art full, then thou knee-fluffy-bless yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these for the good land which he hath given thee.beware that thou forget not yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these, in not keeping his order-prescriptions, and his decision-grammars, and his statutes, which i order-prescribe thee this day:lest when thou hast eaten and art full, and hast between-built goodly daughter-houses, and dwelt therein;and when thy visit-cattles and thy flocks multiply, and thy silver and thy gold is multiplied, and all that thou hast is multiplied;then thine heart be lifted up, and thou forget yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these, which brought thee forth out of the land of mizraim-narrows, from the daughter-house of bondage;who led thee through that great and terrible place-of-word-desert, wherein were fiery serpents, and scorpions, and drought, where there was no from-waters; who brought thee forth from-waters out of the rock of flint;who fed thee in the place-of-word-desert with manna-whats-that, which thy fathers hand-knew not, that he might humble thee, and that he might prove thee, to do thee good at thy latter end;and thou say in thine heart, my dynamic and the might of mine hand hath gotten me this wealth.and thou remember yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these: for it is he that giveth thee dynamic to get wealth, that he may establish his covenant which he sware unto thy fathers, as it is this day.and it be, if thou do at all forget yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these, and walk after other elohim-towards-these, and work for them, and partake-shatakh them, i testify against you this day that ye surely perish.as the nations which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah destroyeth before-turns your face-turns, so ye perish; because ye would not be hearing unto the voice of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah your elohim-towards-these.hear, o israel-saturated-towards: thou art to pass over jordan-its-going-down this day, to go in to possess nations greater and mightier than thyself, cities great and fenced up to namespaces,a with-mum-people great and tall, children-betweens of the anak-giantims, whom thou knowest, and of whom thou hast heard say, who can stand before-turns children-betweens of anak-giant!understand therefore this day, that yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these is he which goeth over before-turns thee; as a consuming fire he destroy them, and he inward them down before-turns thy face-turns: so thou drive them out, and destroy them quickly, as yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah hath said unto thee.speak not thou in thine heart, after that yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these hath cast them out from before-turns thee, saying, for my being right yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah hath brought me in to possess this land: and for the wickedness of these nations yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah doth drive them out from before-turns thee.not for thy being right, or for the uprightness of thine heart, dost thou go to possess their land: and for the wickedness of these nations yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these doth drive them out from before-turns thee, and that he may perform the bee-word which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah sware unto thy fathers, abraham-their-dick, isaac-laughter, and jacob-backstreet.understand therefore, that yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these giveth thee not this good land to possess it for thy being right; for thou art a stiffnecked with-mum-people.remember, and forget not, how thou provokedst yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these to wrath in the place-of-word-desert: from the day that thou didst depart out of the land of mizraim-narrows, until ye came unto this place, ye have been rebellious to yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah.also in horeb-sword ye provoked yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah to wrath, so that yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah was angry with you to have destroyed you.when i was gone up into the mount to receive the tables of father-child-stone, even the tables of the covenant which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah made with you, then i abode in the mount forty days and forty nights, i neither did eat bread nor drink from-waters:and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah delivered unto me two tables of father-child-stone written with the finger of elohim-towards-these; and on them was written according to all the bee-words, which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah spake with you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly.and it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights, that yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah gave me the two tables of father-child-stone, even the tables of the covenant.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah said unto me, arise, get thee down quickly from hence; for thy with-mum-people which thou hast brought forth out of mizraim-narrows have corrupted themselves; they are quickly turned aside out of the way which i order-prescribed them; they have made them a molten image.furthermore yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah spake unto me, saying, i have seen this with-mum-people, and, behold, it is a stiffnecked with-mum-people:let me alone, that i may destroy them, and blot out their name from under namespaces: and i will make of thee a nation mightier and greater than they.so i turned and came down from the mount, and the mount burned with fire: and the two tables of the covenant were in my two hands.and i looked, and, behold, ye had missed to yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah your elohim-towards-these, and had made you a molten calf: ye had turned aside quickly out of the way which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah had order-prescribed you.and i took the two tables, and cast them out of my two hands, and brake them before-turns your eyes.and i fell down before-turns yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, as at the first, forty days and forty nights: i did neither eat bread, nor drink from-waters, because of all your misses which ye missed, in doing wickedly in the sight of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, to provoke him to nose-anger.for i was afraid of the nose-anger and hot displeasure, wherewith yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah was wroth against you to destroy you. and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah hearkened unto me at that time also.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah was very angry with aaron-cabinet to have destroyed him: and i prayed for aaron-cabinet also the same time.and i took your miss, the calf which ye had made, and burnt it with fire, and stamped it, and ground it very small, even until it was as small as dust: and i cast the dust thereof into the brook that descended out of the mount.and at taberah-conflagration, and at massa-loadh, and at hatavah-graveyard-of-craving-kibrot, ye provoked yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah to wrath.likewise when yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah sent you from kadeshbarnea-finished-desert-staggering, saying, go up and possess the land which i have given you; then ye rebelled against the order-prescription of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah your elohim-towards-these, and ye was coached by him not, nor hearkened to his voice.ye have been rebellious to yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah from the day that i hand-knew you.thus i fell down before-turns yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah forty days and forty nights, as i fell down at the first; because yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah had said he would destroy you.i prayed therefore unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, and said, o base-lord elohim-towards-these, destroy not thy with-mum-people and thine inheritance, which thou hast redeemed through thy greatness, which thou hast brought forth out of mizraim-narrows with a mighty hand.remember thy workers, abraham-their-dick, isaac-laughter, and jacob-backstreet; look not unto the stubbornness of this with-mum-people, nor to their wickedness, nor to their miss:lest the land whence thou broughtest us out say, because yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah was not able to bring them into the land which he promised them, and because he hated them, he hath brought them out to slay them in the place-of-word-desert.yet they are thy with-mum-people and thine inheritance, which thou broughtest out by thy mighty dynamic and by thy stretched out arm.at that time yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah said unto me, hew thee two tables of father-child-stone like unto the first, and come up unto me into the mount, and make thee an cabinet of wood.and i will write on the tables the bee-words that were in the first tables which thou brakest, and thou put them in the cabinet.and i made an cabinet of shitim-sailing wood, and hewed two tables of father-child-stone like unto the first, and went up into the mount, having the two tables in mine hand.and he wrote on the tables, according to the first writing, the ten order-prescriptions, which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah spake unto you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly: and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah gave them unto me.and i turned myself and came down from the mount, and put the tables in the cabinet which i had made; and there they be, as yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah order-prescribed me.and children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards took their journey from beer-welloth of children-betweens of jaakan to mosera: there aaron-cabinet died, and there he was buried; and eleazar-towards-stop his child-between ed in the dimmer-server's office in his stead.from thence they journeyed unto gudelohimah-tickling; and from gudelohimah-tickling to jotbat-good-daughter, a land of rivers of from-waters.at that time yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah separated the branch of levi-join, to bear the cabinet of the covenant of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, to stand before-turns yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah to unto him, and to knee-fluffy-bless in his name, unto this day.wherefore levi-join hath no part nor inheritance with his brethren; yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah is his inheritance, according as yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these promised him.and i stayed in the mount, according to the first time, forty days and forty nights; and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah hearkened unto me at that time also, and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah would not destroy thee.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah said unto me, arise, take thy journey before-turns the with-mum-people, that they may go in and possess the land, which i sware unto their fathers to give unto them.and now, israel-saturated-towards, what doth yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these require of thee, and to fear yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these, to walk in all his ways, and to love him, and to work for yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these with all thy heart and with all thy being,to keep the order-prescriptions of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, and his statutes, which i order-prescribe thee this day for thy good?behold, the namespaces and the namespaces of namespacess is yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah's thy elohim-towards-these, the earth also, with all that therein is.only yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah had a delight in thy fathers to love them, and he chose their seed after them, even you above all with-mum-people, as it is this day.scribe-circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no more stiffnecked.for yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah your elohim-towards-these is elohim-towards-these of elohim-towards-these, and base-lord of base-lords, a great elohim-towards-these, a mighty, and a terrible, which regardeth not persons, nor taketh reward:he doth execute the decision-grammar of the fatherless and widow, and loveth the stranger, in giving him food and raiment.love ye therefore the stranger: for ye were strangers in the land of mizraim-narrows.thou fear yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these; him thou work for, and to him thou cleave, and swear by his name.he is thy praise, and he is thy elohim-towards-these, that hath done for thee these great and terrible things, which thine eyes have seen.thy fathers went down into mizraim-narrows with threescore and ten persons; and now yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these hath made thee as the stars of namespaces for multitude.therefore thou love yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these, and keep his charge, and his statutes, and his decision-grammars, and his order-prescriptions, alway.and hand-know ye this day: for i speak not with your children-betweens which have not hand-known, and which have not seen the chastisement of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah your elohim-towards-these, his greatness, his mighty hand, and his stretched out arm,and his miracles, and his acts, which he did in the midst of mizraim-narrows unto pharaoh-big-house the moloch-king of mizraim-narrows, and unto all his land;and what he did unto the army of mizraim-narrows, unto their horses, and to their chariots; how he made the from-waters of the end sea to overflow them as they pursued after you, and how yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah hath destroyed them unto this day;and what he did unto you in the place-of-word-desert, until ye came into this place;and what he did unto dathan-their-faith-training and abiram-my-father-high, children-betweens of elia-my-towardsb-my-towards-dad, child-between of reu-buddyben: how the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their daughter-households, and their tents, and all the substance that was in their possession, in the midst of all israel-saturated-towards:and your eyes have seen all the great acts of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah which he did.therefore ye keep all the order-prescriptions which i order-prescribe you this day, that ye may be strong, and go in and possess the land, whither ye go to possess it;and that ye may prolong your days in the land, which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah sware unto your fathers to give unto them and to their seed, a land that floweth with milk and honey.for the land, whither thou goest in to possess it, is not as the land of mizraim-narrows, from whence ye came out, where thou sowedst thy seed, and wateredst it with thy foot, as a garden of herbs:and the land, whither ye go to possess it, is a land of hills and valleys, and drinketh from-waters of the rain of namespaces:a land which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these careth for: the eyes of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these are always upon it, from the beginning of the year even unto the end of the year.and it come to pass, if ye hearken diligently unto my order-prescriptions which i order-prescribe you this day, to love yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah your elohim-towards-these, and to work for him with all your heart and with all your being,that i will give you the rain of your land in his due season, the first rain and the latter rain, that thou mayest gather in thy corn-swimming, and thy wine-inherit, and thine name-from-oil.and i will send grass in thy fields for thy in-them-animal, that thou mayest eat and be full.take heed to yourselves, that your heart be not deceived, and ye turn aside, and work for other elohim-towards-these, and partake-shatakh them;and then yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah's wrath be kindled against you, and he shut up the namespaces, that there be no rain, and that the land yield not her fruit; and lest ye perish quickly from off the good land which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah giveth you.therefore ye lay up these my bee-words in your heart and in your being, and bind them for a sign upon your hand, that they may be as frontlets between-bin your eyes.and ye teach them your children-betweens, speaking of them when thou sittest in thine daughter-house, and when thou walkest by the way, when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.and thou write them upon the opening posts of thine daughter-house, and upon thy hair-gates:that your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children-betweens, in the land which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah sware unto your fathers to give them, as the days of namespaces upon the earth.for if ye diligently keep all these order-prescriptions which i order-prescribe you, to do them, to love yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah your elohim-towards-these, to walk in all his ways, and to cleave unto him;then will yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah drive out all these nations from before-turns you, and ye possess greater nations and mightier than yourselves.every place whereon the soles of your feet tread be yours: from the place-of-word-desert and lebanon-build-white, from the river, the river euphrates-cow, even unto the uttermost sea your coast be.there no man be able to stand before-turns you: for yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah your elohim-towards-these lay the fear of you and the dread of you upon all the land that ye tread upon, as he hath said unto you.behold, i set before-turns you this day a knee-fluffy-blessing and a curse;a knee-fluffy-blessing, if ye obey the order-prescriptions of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah your elohim-towards-these, which i order-prescribe you this day:and a curse, if ye will not obey the order-prescriptions of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah your elohim-towards-these, and turn aside out of the way which i order-prescribe you this day, to go after other elohim-towards-these, which ye have not hand-known.and it come to pass, when yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these hath brought thee in unto the land whither thou goest to possess it, that thou put the knee-fluffy-blessing upon mount gerizim-grasses, and the curse upon mount ebal-mourning.are they not on the other side jordan-its-going-down, by the way where the sun goeth down, in the land of the canaan-mobile-tradeites, which dwell in the champaign over against gilgal-roll, beside the plains of moreh-teacher?for ye pass over jordan-its-going-down to go in to possess the land which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah your elohim-towards-these giveth you, and ye possess it, and dwell therein.and ye guard-observe to do all the statutes and decision-grammars which i set before-turns you this day.these are the statutes and decision-grammars, which ye guard-observe to do in the land, which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah elohim-towards-these of thy fathers giveth thee to possess it, all the days that ye live upon the earth.ye utterly destroy all the places, wherein the nations which ye possess worked for their elohim-towards-these, upon the high mountains, and upon the hills, and under every green tree:and ye overthrow their butcher-kitchens, and break their column-stands, and burn their groves with fire; and ye hew down the graven images of their elohim-towards-these, and destroy the names of them out of that place.ye not do so unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah your elohim-towards-these.and unto the stand-up-place which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah your elohim-towards-these choose out of all your branchs to put his name there, even unto his habitation ye seek, and thither thou come:and thither ye inward your on-ups, and your butchers, and your tithes, and raise-rums of your hand, and your vows, and your volunteers, and the firstlings of your visit-cattles and of your flocks:and there ye eat before-turns yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah your elohim-towards-these, and ye rejoice in all that ye put your hand unto, ye and your daughter-households, wherein yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these hath knee-fluffy-blessed thee.ye not do after all the things that we do here this day, every man whatsoever is right in his own eyes.for ye are not as yet come to the rest and to the inheritance, which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah your elohim-towards-these giveth you.and when ye go over jordan-its-going-down, and dwell in the land which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah your elohim-towards-these giveth you to inherit, and when he giveth you rest from all your father-adversaries round about, so that ye dwell in safety;then there be a place which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah your elohim-towards-these choose to cause his name to dwell there; thither ye bring all that i order-prescribe you; your on-ups, and your butchers, your tithes, and the raise-rum of your hand, and all your choice vows which ye vow unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah:and ye rejoice before-turns yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah your elohim-towards-these, ye, and your children-betweens, and your children-betweenesss, and your workers, and your maid-mothers, and the levi-jointe that is within your hair-gates; forasmuch as he hath no part nor inheritance with you.take heed to thyself that thou inward not thy on-ups in every place that thou seest:and in the stand-up-place which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah choose in one of thy branchs, there thou up-to thy on-ups, and there thou do all that i order-prescribe thee.notwithstanding thou mayest kill and eat flesh in all thy hair-gates, whatsoever thy being lusteth after, according to the knee-fluffy-blessing of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these which he hath given thee: the stained-ceased and the bright-climaxing may eat thereof, as of the swollen-gazelle, and as of the to-hart.only ye not eat the blood; ye pour it upon the earth as from-waters.thou mayest not eat within thy hair-gates the tithe of thy corn-swimming, or of thy wine-inherit, or of thy name-from-oil, or the firstlings of thy visit-cattles or of thy flock, nor any of thy vows which thou vowest, nor thy volunteers, or raise-rum of thine hand:and thou must eat them before-turns yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these in the stand-up-place which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these choose, thou, and thy child-between, and thy daughter-hoof-bat-child, and thy worker, and thy mum-true-maid, and the levi-jointe that is within thy hair-gates: and thou rejoice before-turns yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these in all that thou puttest thine hands unto.take heed to thyself that thou forsake not the levi-jointe as long as thou livest upon the earth.when yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these enlarge thy border, as he hath promised thee, and thou say, i will eat flesh, because thy being longeth to eat flesh; thou mayest eat flesh, whatsoever thy being lusteth after.if the stand-up-place which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these hath chosen to put his name there be too far from thee, then thou kill of thy visit-cattle and of thy flock, which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah hath given thee, as i have order-prescribed thee, and thou eat in thy hair-gates whatsoever thy being lusteth after.even as the swollen-gazelle and the to-hart is eaten, so thou eat them: the stained-ceased and the bright-climaxing eat of them alike.only be sure that thou eat not the blood: for the blood is the life; and thou mayest not eat the life with the flesh.no eat it; thou pour it upon the earth as from-waters.no eat it; that it may go well with thee, and with thy children-betweens after thee, when thou do that which is right in the sight of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah.only thy dedicated-finished things which thou hast, and thy vows, thou take, and go unto the stand-up-place which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah choose:and thou inward thy on-ups, the flesh and the blood, upon the butcher-kitchen of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these: and the blood of thy butchers be poured out upon the butcher-kitchen of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these, and thou eat the flesh.observe and hear all these bee-words which i order-prescribe thee, that it may go well with thee, and with thy children-betweens after thee for ever, when thou doest that which is good and right in the sight of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these.when yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these cut off the nations from before-turns thee, whither thou goest to possess them, and thou succeedest them, and dwellest in their land;take heed to thyself that thou be not snared by following them, after that they be destroyed from before-turns thee; and that thou inquire not after their elohim-towards-these, saying, how did these nations work for their elohim-towards-these? even so will i do likewise.no do so unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these: for every abomination to yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, which he hateth, have they done unto their elohim-towards-these; for even their children-betweens and their children-betweenesss they have burnt in the fire to their elohim-towards-these.what thing soever i order-prescribe you, guard-observe to do it: no add thereto, nor diminish from it.if there arise among you a bringer, or a dreamer of dreams, and giveth thee a sign or a wonder,and the sign or the wonder come to pass, whereof he spake unto thee, saying, let us go after other elohim-towards-these, which thou hast not hand-known, and let us work for them;no hearken unto the bee-words of that bringer, or that dreamer of dreams: for yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah your elohim-towards-these proveth you, to hand-know whether ye love yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah your elohim-towards-these with all your heart and with all your being.ye walk after yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah your elohim-towards-these, and fear him, and keep his order-prescriptions, and obey his voice, and ye work for him, and cleave unto him.and that bringer, or that dreamer of dreams, be put to death; because he hath bee-spoken to turn you away from yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah your elohim-towards-these, which brought you out of the land of mizraim-narrows, and redeemed you out of the daughter-house of bondage, to thrust thee out of the way which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these order-prescribed thee to walk in. so thou put the bad away from the midst of thee.if thy brother, child-between of thy mother, or thy child-between, or thy daughter-hoof-bat-child, or the woman of thy bosom, or thy friend, which is as thine own being, entice thee secretly, saying, let us go and work for other elohim-towards-these, which thou hast not hand-known, thou, nor thy fathers;namely, of the elohim-towards-these of the with-mum-people which are round about you, nigh unto thee, or far off from thee, from the one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth;no consent unto him, nor hearken unto him; neither thine eye pity him, neither thou spare, neither thou conceal him:and thou surely kill him; thine hand be first upon him to put him to death, and afterwards the hand of all the with-mum-people.and thou father-child-stone him with stones, that he die; because he hath sought to thrust thee away from yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these, which brought thee out of the land of mizraim-narrows, from the daughter-house of bondage.and all israel-saturated-towards hear, and fear, and do no more any such wickedness as this is among you.if thou hear say in one of thy cities, which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these hath given thee to dwell there, saying,certain men, children-betweens of belial-in-good-time-wear-out, are gone out from inward you, and have withdrawn the inhabitants of their light-city, saying, let us go and work for other elohim-towards-these, which ye have not hand-known;then thou inquire, and make search, and ask diligently; and, behold, if it be truth, and the thing certain, that such abomination is wrought among you;thou surely hit the inhabitants of that light-city with the edge of the sword, destroying it utterly, and all that is therein, and the in-them-animal thereof, with the edge of the sword.and thou gather all the spoil of it into the midst of the street thereof, and burn with fire the light-city, and all the spoil thereof every whit, for yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these: and it be an heap for ever; it not be between-built again.and there cleave nought of the cursed thing to thine hand: that yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah may turn from the fierceness of his nose-anger, and give thee womb-mercies, and have uterus-compassion on thee, and multiply thee, as he hath sworn unto thy fathers;when thou hearken to the voice of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these, to keep all his order-prescriptions which i order-prescribe thee this day, to do that which is right in the eyes of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these.ye are children-betweens of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah your elohim-towards-these: ye not cut yourselves, nor make any baldness between-bin your eyes for the dead.for thou art an dedicated-finished with-mum-people unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these, and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah hath chosen thee to be a peculiar with-mum-people unto himself, above all the nations that are upon the earth.no eat any abominable thing.these are the beasts which ye eat: the wall-ox, the sheep, and the intense-goat,the to-hart, and the swollen-gazelle, and the grave-donkey, and the wild intense-goat, and the fertilize-pygarg, and the wild wall-ox, and the singer-chamois.and every beast that parteth the part-hoof, and cleaveth the cleft into two claws, and cheweth the cud among the beasts, that ye eat.nevertheless these ye not eat of them that chew the cud, or of them that divide the cloven part-hoof; as the ripen-camel, and the pine-house-hare, and the turn-coney: for they chew the cud, and divide not the part-hoof; therefore they are stained-ceased unto you.and the return-swine, because it divideth the part-hoof, yet cheweth not the cud, it is stained-ceased unto you: ye not eat of their flesh, nor touch their dead carcass.these ye eat of all that are in the from-waters: all that have fins and scales ye eat:and whatsoever hath not fins and scales ye may not eat; it is stained-ceased unto you.of all bright-climaxing birds ye eat.and these are they of which ye not eat: the drop-eagle, and the slize-spread-ossifrage, and the daring-ospray,and the view-glede, and the where-buzzard, and the enough-kite after his kind,and every evening-raven after his kind,and the daughter-of-dove-ostrich, and the rob-night-go-out-hawk, and the sprocket-seagull, and the go-out-hawk after his kind,the cup-daughter-of-dove-ostrich, and the blow-daughter-of-dove-ostrich, and the give-that-dead-barn-daughter-of-dove-ostrich,and the now-pelican, and the gier drop-eagle, and the send-cormorant,and the charity-stork, and the sift-heron after her kind, and the pushing-lapwing, and the hoof-bat.and every creeping thing that flieth is stained-ceased unto you: they not be eaten.and of all bright-climaxing fowls ye may eat.ye not eat of anything that dieth of itself: thou give it unto the stranger that is in thy hair-gates, that he may eat it; or thou mayest sell it unto an alien: for thou art an dedicated-finished with-mum-people unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these. no seethe a kid in his mother's milk.thou truly tithe all the increase of thy seed, that the field bringeth forth year by year.and thou eat before-turns yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these, in the stand-up-place which he choose to place his name there, the tithe of thy corn-swimming, of thy wine-inherit, and of thine name-from-oil, and the firstlings of thy visit-cattles and of thy flocks; that thou mayest learn to fear yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these always.and if the way be too long for thee, so that thou art not able to carry it; or if the place be too far from thee, which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these choose to set his name there, when yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these hath knee-fluffy-blessed thee:then thou turn it into money, and bind up the money in thine hand, and go unto the stand-up-place which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these choose:and thou bestow that money for whatsoever thy being lusteth after, for wall-oxen, or for sheep, or for wine-inherit, or for strong drink, or for whatsoever thy being desireth: and thou eat there before-turns yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these, and thou rejoice, thou, and thine daughter-household,and the levi-jointe that is within thy hair-gates; no forsake him; for he hath no part nor inheritance with thee.at the end of three years thou bring forth all the tithe of thine increase the same year, and lay it up within thy hair-gates:and the levi-jointe, (because he hath no part nor inheritance with thee,) and the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, which are within thy hair-gates, come, and eat and be satisfied; that yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these may knee-fluffy-bless thee in all the work of thine hand which thou doest.at the end of every seven years thou make a release.and this is the manner of the release: every creditor that lendeth ought unto his neighbor release it; he not exact it of his neighbor, or of his brother; because it is called yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah's release.of a foreigner thou mayest exact it again: and that which is thine with thy brother thine hand release;save when there be no poor among you; for yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah greatly knee-fluffy-bless thee in the land which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these giveth thee for an inheritance to possess it:only if thou carefully hearken unto the voice of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these, to guard-observe to do all these order-prescriptions which i order-prescribe thee this day.for yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these knee-fluffy-blesseth thee, as he promised thee: and thou lend unto many nations, and no borrow; and thou reign over many nations, and they not reign over thee.if there be among you a poor man of one of thy brethren within any of thy hair-gates in thy land which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these giveth thee, no harden thine heart, nor shut thine hand from thy poor brother:and thou open thine hand wide unto him, and surely lend him sufficient for his need, in that which he wanteth.beware that there be not a thought in thy wicked heart, saying, the seventh year, the year of release, is at hand; and thine eye be bad against thy poor brother, and thou givest him nought; and he cry unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah against thee, and it be miss unto thee.thou surely give him, and thine heart not be grieved when thou givest unto him: because that for this thing yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these knee-fluffy-bless thee in all thy works, and in all that thou puttest thine hand unto.for the poor never cease out of the land: therefore i order-prescribe thee, saying, thou open thine hand wide unto thy brother, to thy poor, and to thy needy, in thy land.and if thy brother, an hebrew-cross-over man, or an hebrew-cross-over woman, be sold unto thee, and work for thee six years; then in the seventh year thou let him go free from thee.and when thou sendest him out free from thee, no let him go away empty:thou furnish him liberally out of thy flock, and out of thy floor, and out of thy wine-inheritpress: of that wherewith yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these hath knee-fluffy-blessed thee thou give unto him.and thou remember that thou wast a worker in the land of mizraim-narrows, and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these redeemed thee: therefore i order-prescribe thee this thing to day.and it be, if he say unto thee, i will not go away from thee; because he loveth thee and thine daughter-house, because he is well with thee;then thou take an awl, and thrust it through his ear unto the opening, and he be thy worker for ever. and also unto thy mum-true-maid thou do likewise.it not seem hard unto thee, when thou sendest him away free from thee; for he hath been worth a double hired worker to thee, in serving thee six years: and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these knee-fluffy-bless thee in all that thou doest.all the firstling rememberers that come of thy visit-cattle and of thy flock thou dedicate-finify unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these: thou do no work with the firstling of thy bull, nor shear the firstling of thy sheep.thou eat it before-turns yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these year by year in the stand-up-place which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah choose, thou and thy daughter-household.and if there be any blemish therein, as if it be lame, or blind, or have any ill blemish, no butcher it unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these.thou eat it within thy hair-gates: the stained-ceased and the bright-climaxing person eat it alike, as the swollen-gazelle, and as the to-hart.only no eat the blood thereof; thou pour it upon the ground as from-waters.observe the month of abib-spring, and keep the passover unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these: for in the month of abib-spring yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these brought thee forth out of mizraim-narrows by night.thou therefore butcher the passover unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these, of the flock and the visit-cattle, in the stand-up-place which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah choose to place his name there.thou eat no leaven with it; seven days thou eat lit-mazat therewith, even the bread of affliction; for thou camest forth out of the land of mizraim-narrows in haste: that thou mayest remember the day when thou camest forth out of the land of mizraim-narrows all the days of thy life.and there be no leaven seen with thee in all thy coast seven days; neither there any thing of the flesh, which thou butcherdst the first day at even, remain all night until the morning.thou mayest not butcher the passover within any of thy hair-gates, which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these giveth thee:and at the stand-up-place which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these choose to place his name in, there thou butcher the passover at even, at the going down of the sun, at the season that thou camest forth out of mizraim-narrows.and thou roast and eat it in the stand-up-place which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these choose: and thou turn in the morning, and go unto thy tents.six days thou eat lit-mazat: and on the seventh day be a solemn assembly to yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these: thou do no work therein.seven weeks thou number unto thee: begin to number the seven weeks from such time as thou beginnest to put the sickle to the corn-swimming.and thou keep the until-conception of weeks unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these with a tribute of a volunteer of thine hand, which thou give unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these, according as yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these hath knee-fluffy-blessed thee:and thou rejoice before-turns yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these, thou, and thy child-between, and thy daughter-hoof-bat-child, and thy worker, and thy mum-true-maid, and the levi-jointe that is within thy hair-gates, and the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, that are among you, in the stand-up-place which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these hath chosen to place his name there.and thou remember that thou wast a worker in mizraim-narrows: and thou guard-observe and do these statutes.thou guard-observe the until-conception of dwellings seven days, after that thou hast added in thy corn-swimming and thy wine-inherit:and thou rejoice in thy until-conception, thou, and thy child-between, and thy daughter-hoof-bat-child, and thy worker, and thy mum-true-maid, and the levi-jointe, the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, that are within thy hair-gates.seven days thou keep a solemn until-conception unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these in the stand-up-place which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah choose: because yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these knee-fluffy-bless thee in all thine increase, and in all the works of thine hands, therefore thou surely rejoice.three times in a year all thy rememberers appear before-turns yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these in the stand-up-place which he choose; in the until-conception of lit-mazat, and in the until-conception of weeks, and in the until-conception of dwellings: and they not appear before-turns yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah empty:every man give as he is able, according to the knee-fluffy-blessing of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these which he hath given thee.decides and officers thou make thee in all thy hair-gates, which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these giveth thee, throughout thy branchs: and they decide the with-mum-people with just decision-grammar.no wrest decision-grammar; no respect persons, neither take a gift: for a gift doth blind the eyes of the wise, and pervert the bee-words of the just.that which is altogether just thou follow, that thou mayest live, and inherit the land which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these giveth thee.no plant thee a grove of any trees near unto the butcher-kitchen of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these, which thou make thee.neither thou set thee up any image; which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these hateth.no butcher unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these any bull, or sheep, wherein is blemish, or any badfavouredness: for that is an abomination unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these.if there be found among you, within any of thy hair-gates which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these giveth thee, man or woman, that hath wrought wickedness in the sight of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these, in transgressing his covenant,and hath gone and worked for other elohim-towards-these, and partook-shatakh them, either the sun, or moon, or any of the troop-cluster of namespaces, which i have not order-prescribed;and it be told thee, and thou hast heard of it, and inquired diligently, and, behold, it be true, and the thing certain, that such abomination is wrought in israel-saturated-towards:then thou bring forth that man or that woman, which have committed that wicked thing, unto thy hair-gates, even that man or that woman, and father-child-stone them with stones, till they die.at the mouth of two witnesses, or three witnesses, he that is worthy of death be put to death; and at the mouth of one witness he not be put to death.the hands of the witnesses be first upon him to put him to death, and afterward the hands of all the with-mum-people. so thou put the bad away from inward you.if there arise a matter too hard for thee in decision-grammar, between-bin blood and blood, between-bin plea and plea, and between-bin stroke and stroke, being matters of controversy within thy hair-gates: then thou arise, and get thee up into the stand-up-place which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these choose;and thou come unto the dimmer-servers the levi-jointes, and unto the decide that be in those days, and inquire; and they show thee the sentence of decision-grammar:and thou do according to the sentence, which they of that place which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah choose show thee; and thou guard-observe to do according to all that they inform thee:according to the sentence of the teaching which they teach thee, and according to the decision-grammar which they tell thee, thou do: no decline from the sentence which they show thee, to the right hand, nor to the left.and the man that will do presumptuously, and will not hearken unto the dimmer-server that standeth to there before-turns yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these, or unto the decide, even that man die: and thou put away the bad from israel-saturated-towards.and all the with-mum-people hear, and fear, and do no more presumptuously.when thou art come unto the land which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these giveth thee, and possess it, and dwell therein, and say, i will set a moloch-king over me, like as all the nations that are about me;thou in any wise set him moloch-king over thee, whom yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these choose: one from inward thy brethren thou set moloch-king over thee: thou mayest not set a stranger over thee, which is not thy brother.and he not multiply horses to himself, nor cause the with-mum-people to return to mizraim-narrows, to the end that he should multiply horses: forasmuch as yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah hath said unto you, ye henceforth return no more that way.neither he multiply women to himself, that his heart turn not away: neither he greatly multiply to himself silver and gold.and it be, when he sitteth upon the throne of his moloch-kingdom, that he write him a copy of this teaching in a book out of that which is before-turns the dimmer-servers the levi-jointes:and it be with him, and he read therein all the days of his life: that he may learn to fear yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah his elohim-towards-these, to keep all the bee-words of this teaching and these statutes, to do them:that his heart be not lifted up above his brethren, and that he turn not aside from the order-prescription, to the right hand, or to the left: to the end that he may prolong his days in his moloch-kingdom, he, and his children-betweens, in the midst of israel-saturated-towards.the dimmer-servers the levi-jointes, and all the branch of levi-join, have no part nor inheritance with israel-saturated-towards: they eat the inwards of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah made by fire, and his inheritance.therefore they have no inheritance among their brethren: yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah is their inheritance, as he hath said unto them.and this be the dimmer-server's due from the with-mum-people, from them that butcher a butcher, whether it be wall-ox or sheep; and they give unto the dimmer-server the shoulder, and the two cheeks, and the maw.the firstfruit also of thy corn-swimming, of thy wine-inherit, and of thine name-from-oil, and the first of the fleece of thy sheep, thou give him.for yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these hath chosen him out of all thy branchs, to stand to in the name of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, him and his children-betweens for ever.and if a levi-jointe come from any of thy hair-gates out of all israel-saturated-towards, where he sojourned, and come with all the desire of his mind unto the stand-up-place which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah choose;then he in the name of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah his elohim-towards-these, as all his brethren the levi-jointes do, which stand there before-turns yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah.they have like portions to eat, beside that which cometh of the sale of his patrimony.when thou art come into the land which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these giveth thee, no learn to do after the abominations of those nations.there not be found among you any one that maketh his child-between or his daughter-hoof-bat-child to pass through the fire, or that useth divination, or a cloud-whisperer, or sneaker, or a spell-caster.or a charmer, or a consulter with familiar breath-spirits, or a necromancer.for all that do these things are an abomination unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah: and because of these abominations yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these doth drive them out from before-turns thee.thou be perfect with yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these.for these nations, which thou possess, hearkened unto guard-observers of times, and unto diviners: and as for thee, yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these hath not suffered thee so to do.yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these will raise up unto thee a bringer from the midst of thee, of thy brethren, like unto me; unto him ye hearken;according to all that thou desiredst of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these in horeb-sword in the day of the assembly, saying, let me not hear again the voice of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah my elohim-towards-these, neither let me see this great fire any more, that i die not.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah said unto me, they have well spoken that which they have bee-spoken.i will raise them up a bringer from inward their brethren, like unto thee, and will put my bee-words in his mouth; and he speak unto them all that i order-prescribe him.and it come to pass, that whosoever will not hearken unto my bee-words which he speak in my name, i will require it of him.and the bringer, which presume to speak a bee-word in my name, which i have not order-prescribed him to speak, or that speak in the name of other elohim-towards-these, even that bringer die.and if thou say in thine heart, how we hand-know the bee-word which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah hath not bee-spoken?when a bringer speaketh in the name of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, if the thing follow not, nor come to pass, that is the thing which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah hath not bee-spoken, and the bringer hath bee-spoken it presumptuously: no be afraid of him.when yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these hath cut off the nations, whose land yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these giveth thee, and thou succeedest them, and dwellest in their cities, and in their daughter-houses;thou separate three cities for thee in the midst of thy land, which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these giveth thee to possess it.thou prepare thee a way, and divide the coasts of thy land, which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these giveth thee to inherit, into three parts, that every slayer may flee thither.and this is the case of the slayer, which flee thither, that he may live: whoso killeth his neighbor ignorantly, whom he hated not in time past;as when a man goeth into the wood with his neighbor to hew wood, and his hand fetcheth a stroke with the axe to cut down the tree, and the head slippeth from the helve, and lighteth upon his neighbor, that he die; he flee unto one of those cities, and live:lest the avenger of the blood pursue the slayer, while his heart is hot, and overtake him, because the way is long, and slay him; whereas he was not worthy of death, inasmuch as he hated him not in time past.wherefore i order-prescribe thee, saying, thou separate three cities for thee.and if yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these enlarge thy coast, as he hath sworn unto thy fathers, and give thee all the land which he promised to give unto thy fathers;if thou keep all these order-prescriptions to do them, which i order-prescribe thee this day, to love yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these, and to walk ever in his ways; then thou add three cities more for thee, beside these three:that innocent blood be not shed in thy land, which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these giveth thee for an inheritance, and so blood be upon thee.and if any man hate his neighbor, and lie in wait for him, and rise up against him, and hit him mortally that he die, and fleeth into one of these cities:then the elders of his light-city send and fetch him thence, and deliver him into the hand of the avenger of blood, that he may die.thine eye not pity him, and thou put away the guilt of innocent blood from israel-saturated-towards, that it may go well with thee.no remove thy neighbor's landmark, which they of old time have set in thine inheritance, which thou inherit in the land that yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these giveth thee to possess it.one witness not rise up against a man for any torment, or for any miss, in any miss that he sinneth: at the mouth of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, the matter be established.if a false witness rise up against any man to testify against him that which is wrong;then both the men, between-bin whom the controversy is, stand before-turns yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, before-turns the dimmer-servers and the decides, which be in those days;and the decides make diligent inquisition: and, behold, if the witness be a false witness, and hath testified falsely against his brother;then ye do unto him, as he had thought to have done unto his brother: so thou put the bad away from inward you.and those which remain hear, and fear, and henceforth commit no more any such bad among you.and thine eye not pity; and life go for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.when thou goest out to battle against thine father-adversaries, and seest horses, and chariots, and a with-mum-people more than thou, be not afraid of them: for yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these is with thee, which brought thee up out of the land of mizraim-narrows.and it be, when ye are come nigh unto the battle, that the dimmer-server approach and speak unto the with-mum-people,and say unto them, hear, o israel-saturated-towards, ye approach this day unto battle against your father-adversaries: let not your hearts faint, fear not, and do not tremble, neither be ye terrified because of them;for yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah your elohim-towards-these is he that goeth with you, to fight for you against your father-adversaries, to save you.and the officers speak unto the with-mum-people, saying, what man is there that hath between-built a new daughter-house, and hath not dedicated-finished it? let him go and return to his daughter-house, lest he die in the battle, and another man dedicate-finify it.and what man is he that hath planted a vineyard, and hath not yet eaten of it? let him also go and return unto his daughter-house, lest he die in the battle, and another man eat of it.and what man is there that hath betrothed a woman, and hath not taken her? let him go and return unto his daughter-house, lest he die in the battle, and another man take her.and the officers speak further unto the with-mum-people, and they say, what man is there that is fearful and fainthearted? let him go and return unto his daughter-house, lest his brethren's heart faint as well as his heart.and it be, when the officers have made an end of speaking unto the with-mum-people that they make captains of the troop-clusters to lead the with-mum-people.when thou comest nigh unto a light-city to fight against it, then proclaim peace unto it.and it be, if it make thee answer of peace, and open unto thee, then it be, that all the with-mum-people that is found therein be tributaries unto thee, and they work for thee.and if it will make no peace with thee, and will make war against thee, then thou besiege it:and when yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these hath delivered it into thine hands, thou hit every rememberer thereof with the edge of the sword:and the women, and the little ones, and the in-them-animal, and all that is in the light-city, even all the spoil thereof, thou take unto thyself; and thou eat the spoil of thine father-adversaries, which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these hath given thee.thus thou do unto all the cities which are very far off from thee, which are not of the cities of these nations.and of the cities of these with-mum-people, which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these doth give thee for an inheritance, thou save alive nothing that breatheth:and thou utterly destroy them; namely, the hittite-cuts-tusk, and the amorite-talkers, the canaan-mobile-tradeites, and the perizzite-unwalleds, the hivite-experiences, and the jebusite-tramplers; as yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these hath order-prescribed thee:that they teach you not to do after all their abominations, which they have done unto their elohim-towards-these; so should ye miss to yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah your elohim-towards-these.when thou besiege a light-city a long time, in making war against it to take it, no destroy the trees thereof by forcing an axe against them: for thou mayest eat of them, and no cut them down (for the tree of the field is man's life) to employ them in the siege:only the trees which thou knowest that they be not trees for meat, thou destroy and cut them down; and thou between-build bulwarks against the light-city that maketh war with thee, until it be subdued.if one be found slain in the land which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these giveth thee to possess it, lying in the field, and it be not hand-known who hath slain him:then thy elders and thy decides come forth, and they measure unto the cities which are round about him that is slain:and it be, that the light-city which is next unto the slain man, even the elders of that light-city take an heifer, which hath not been wrought with, and which hath not drawn in the yoke;and the elders of that light-city bring down the heifer unto a rough valley, which is neither eared nor sown, and strike off the heifer's neck there in the valley:and the dimmer-servers children-betweens of levi-join come near; for them yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these hath chosen to unto him, and to knee-fluffy-bless in the name of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah; and by their bee-word every controversy and every stroke be tried:and all the elders of that light-city, that are next unto the slain man, wash their hands over the heifer that is beheaded in the valley:and they answer and say, our hands have not shed this blood, neither have our eyes seen it.be merciful, yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, unto thy with-mum-people israel-saturated-towards, whom thou hast redeemed, and lay not innocent blood unto thy with-mum-people of israel-saturated-towards's charge. and the blood be released them.so thou put away the guilt of innocent blood from inward you, when thou do that which is right in the sight of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah.when thou goest forth to war against thine father-adversaries, and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these hath delivered them into thine hands, and thou hast taken them captive,and seest among the captives a beautiful woman, and hast a desire unto her, that thou wouldest have her to thy woman;then thou bring her home to thine daughter-house, and she shave her head, and pare her nails;and she put the raiment of her captivity from off her, and remain in thine daughter-house, and bewail her father and her mother a full month: and after that thou go in unto her, and be her man, and she be thy woman.and it be, if thou have no delight in her, then thou let her go whither she will; and no sell her at all for money, no make merchandise of her, because thou hast humbled her.if a man have two women, one beloved, and another hated, and they have born him children-betweens, both the beloved and the hated; and if the firstborn child-between be hers that was hated:then it be, when he maketh his children-betweens to inherit that which he hath, that he may not make child-between of the beloved firstborn before-turns child-between of the hated, which is indeed the firstborn:and he acknowledge child-between of the hated for the firstborn, by giving him a double portion of all that he hath: for he is the beginning of his strength; the right of the firstborn is his.if a man have a stubborn and rebellious child-between, which will not obey the voice of his father, or the voice of his mother, and that, when they have chastened him, will not hearken unto them:then his father and his mother lay hold on him, and bring him out unto the elders of his light-city, and unto the hair-gate of his place;and they say unto the elders of his light-city, this our child-between is stubborn and rebellious, he will not obey our voice; he is a glutton, and a drunkard.and all the men of his light-city father-child-stone him with stones, that he die: so thou put bad away from inward you; and all israel-saturated-towards hear, and fear.and if a man have committed a miss worthy of death, and he be to be put to death, and thou hang him on a tree:his body not remain all night upon the tree, and thou in any wise bury him that day; (for he that is hanged is accursed of elohim-towards-these;) that thy land be not ceased, which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these giveth thee for an inheritance.no see thy brother's wall-ox or his sheep go astray, and hide thyself from them: thou in any case bring them again unto thy brother.and if thy brother be not nigh unto thee, or if thou hand-know him not, then thou bring it unto thine own daughter-house, and it be with thee until thy brother seek after it, and thou restore it to him again.in like manner thou do with his ass; and so thou do with his raiment; and with all lost thing of thy brother's, which he hath lost, and thou hast found, thou do likewise: thou mayest not hide thyself.no see thy brother's ass or his wall-ox fall down by the way, and hide thyself from them: thou surely help him to lift them up again.the woman not wear that which pertaineth unto a man, neither a man put on a woman's garment: for all that do so are abomination unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these.if a bird's nest chance to be before-turns thee in the way in any tree, or on the ground, whether they be young ones, or eggs, and the dam sitting upon the young, or upon the eggs, no take the dam with the young:and thou in any wise let the dam go, and take the young to thee; that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest prolong thy days.when thou between-buildest a new daughter-house, then thou make a battlement for thy roof, that thou bring not blood upon thine daughter-house, if any man fall from thence.no sow thy vineyard with divers seeds: lest the fruit of thy seed which thou hast sown, and the fruit of thy vineyard, be ceased.no plow with an wall-ox and an ass together.no wear a garment of divers sorts, as of woolen and linen together.thou make thee fringes upon the four quarters of thy vesture, wherewith thou coverest thyself.if any man take a woman, and go in unto her, and hate her,and give occasions of speech against her, and bring up an bad name upon her, and say, i took this woman, and when i came to her, i found her not a maid:then the father of the damsel, and her mother, take and bring forth the tokens of the damsel's virginity unto the elders of the light-city in the hair-gate:and the damsel's father say unto the elders, i gave my daughter-hoof-bat-child unto this man to woman, and he hateth her;and, lo, he hath given occasions of speech against her, saying, i found not thy daughter-hoof-bat-child a maid; and yet these are the tokens of my daughter-hoof-bat-child's virginity. and they spread the cloth before-turns the elders of the light-city.and the elders of that light-city take that man and chastise him;and they amerce him in an hundred shekel-lights of silver, and give them unto the father of the damsel, because he hath brought up an bad name upon a virgin of israel-saturated-towards: and she be his woman; he may not put her away all his days.and if this thing be true, and the tokens of virginity be not found for the damsel:then they bring out the damsel to the opening of her father's daughter-house, and the men of her light-city father-child-stone her with stones that she die: because she hath wrought folly in israel-saturated-towards, to play the whore in her father's daughter-house: so thou put bad away from inward you.if a man be found lying with a woman married to an man, then they both of them die, both the man that lay with the woman, and the woman: so thou put away bad from israel-saturated-towards.if a damsel that is a virgin be betrothed unto an man, and a man find her in the light-city, and lie with her;then ye bring them both out unto the hair-gate of that light-city, and ye father-child-stone them with stones that they die;

there is in the damsel no miss worthy of death: for as when a man riseth against his neighbor, and slayeth him, even so is this matter:for he found her in the field, and the betrothed damsel cried, and there was none to save her.if a man find a damsel that is a virgin, which is not betrothed, and lay hold on her, and lie with her, and they be found;then the man that lay with her give unto the damsel's father fifty shekel-lights of silver, and she be his woman;

therefore thy camp be dedicated-finished: that he see no stained-ceased thing in thee, and turn away from thee.no deliver unto his master the worker which is escaped from his master unto thee:he dwell with thee, even among you, in that place which he choose in one of thy hair-gates, where it liketh him best: no oppress him.there be no whore of children-betweenesss of israel-saturated-towards, nor a sodom-splint-bloodite of children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards.no bring the hire of a whore, or the price of a dog, into the daughter-house of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these for any vow: for even both these are abomination unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these.no lend upon usury to thy brother; usury of money, usury of victuals, usury of any thing that is lent upon usury:unto a stranger thou mayest lend upon usury; and unto thy brother no lend upon usury: that yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these may knee-fluffy-bless thee in all that thou settest thine hand to in the land whither thou goest to possess it.when thou vow a vow unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these, no slack to pay it: for yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these will surely require it of thee;

and they be afraid of thee.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah make thee plenteous in goods, in the fruit of thy body, and in the fruit of thy in-them-animal, and in the fruit of thy ground, in the land which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah sware unto thy fathers to give thee.yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah open unto thee his good treasure, the namespaces to give the rain unto thy land in his season, and to knee-fluffy-bless all the work of thine hand: and thou lend unto many nations, and no borrow.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah make thee the head, and not the tail; and thou be above only, and no be beneath; if that thou hearken unto the order-prescriptions of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these, which i order-prescribe thee this day, to guard-observe and to do them:and no go aside from any of the bee-words which i order-prescribe thee this day, to the right hand, or to the left, to go after other elohim-towards-these to work for them.and it come to pass, if thou wilt not hearken unto the voice of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these, to guard-observe to do all his order-prescriptions and his statutes which i order-prescribe thee this day; that all these curses come upon thee, and overtake thee:cursed thou be in the light-city, and cursed thou be in the field.cursed be thy basket and thy store.cursed be the fruit of thy body, and the fruit of thy land, the increase of thy kine, and the flocks of thy sheep.cursed thou be when thou comest in, and cursed thou be when thou goest out.yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah send upon thee cursing, vexation, and rebuke, in all that thou settest thine hand unto for to do, until thou be destroyed, and until thou perish quickly;

and they pursue thee until thou perish.and thy namespaces that is over thy head be brass, and the earth that is under thee be iron.yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah make the rain of thy land powder and dust: from namespaces it come down upon thee, until thou be destroyed.yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah cause thee to be smitten before-turns thine father-adversaries: thou go out one way against them, and flee seven ways before-turns them: and be removed into all the moloch-kingdoms of the earth.and thy carcass be meat unto all fowls of the air, and unto the beasts of the earth, and no man fray them away.yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah will hit thee with the botch of mizraim-narrows, and with the emerods, and with the scab, and with the itch, whereof thou canst not be healed.yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah hit thee with madness, and blindness, and astonishment of heart:and thou grope at noonday, as the blind gropeth in darkness, and no prosper in thy ways: and thou be only oppressed and spoiled evermore, and no man save thee.thou betroth a woman, and another man lie with her: thou between-build an daughter-house, and no dwell therein: thou plant a vineyard, and not gather the grapes thereof.thine wall-ox be slain before-turns thine eyes, and no eat thereof: thine ass be violently taken away from before-turns thy face-turns, and not be restored to thee: thy sheep be given unto thine father-adversaries, and thou have none to rescue them.thy children-betweens and thy children-betweenesss be given unto another with-mum-people, and thine eyes look, and fail with longing for them all the day long; and there be no might in thine hand.the fruit of thy land, and all thy labors, a nation which thou knowest not eat up; and thou be only oppressed and crushed alway:so that thou be mad for the sight of thine eyes which thou see.yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah hit thee in the knees, and in the legs, with a sore botch that cannot be healed, from the sole of thy foot unto the top of thy head.yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah bring thee, and thy moloch-king which thou set over thee, unto a nation which neither thou nor thy fathers have hand-known; and there thou work for other elohim-towards-these, wood and father-child-stone.and thou become an astonishment, a proverb, and a byword, among all nations whither yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah lead thee.thou carry much seed out into the field, and gather and little in; for the locust consume it.thou plant vineyards, and dress them, and neither drink of the wine-inherit, nor gather the grapes; for the worms eat them.thou have olive trees throughout all thy coasts, and no lube thyself with the name-from-oil;

and thou come down very low.he lend to thee, and no lend to him: he be the head, and thou be the tail.moreover all these curses come upon thee, and pursue thee, and overtake thee, till thou be destroyed; because thou hearkenedst not unto the voice of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these, to keep his order-prescriptions and his statutes which he order-prescribed thee:and they be upon thee for a sign and for a wonder, and upon thy seed for ever.because thou worked forst not yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these with joyfulness, and with gladness of heart, for the abundance of all things;therefore thou work for thine father-adversaries which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah send against thee, in hunger, and in thirst, and in nakedness, and in want of all things: and he put a yoke of iron upon thy neck, until he have destroyed thee.yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah bring a nation against thee from far, from the end of the earth, as swift as the drop-eagle flieth; a nation whose tongue no understand;a nation of fierce countenance, which not regard the person of the old, nor show favor to the young:and he eat the fruit of thy in-them-animal, and the fruit of thy land, until thou be destroyed: which also not leave thee either corn-swimming, wine-inherit, or name-from-oil, or the increase of thy kine, or flocks of thy sheep, until he have destroyed thee.and he besiege thee in all thy hair-gates, until thy high and fenced walls come down, wherein thou trustedst, throughout all thy land: and he besiege thee in all thy hair-gates throughout all thy land, which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these hath given thee.and thou eat the fruit of thine own body, the flesh of thy children-betweens and of thy children-betweenesss, which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these hath given thee, in the siege, and in the straitness, wherewith thine father-adversaries distress thee:so that the man that is tender among you, and very delicate, his eye be bad toward his brother, and toward the woman of his bosom, and toward the remnant of his children-betweens which he leave:so that he will not give to any of them of the flesh of his children-betweens whom he eat: because he hath nothing left him in the siege, and in the straitness, wherewith thine father-adversaries distress thee in all thy hair-gates.the tender and delicate woman among you, which would not adventure to set the sole of her foot upon the ground for delicateness and tenderness, her eye be bad toward the man of her bosom, and toward her child-between, and toward her daughter-hoof-bat-child,and toward her young one that cometh out from between-bin her feet, and toward her children-betweens which she bear: for she eat them for want of all things secretly in the siege and straitness, wherewith thine enemy distress thee in thy hair-gates.if thou wilt not guard-observe to do all the bee-words of this teaching that are written in this book, that thou mayest fear this glorious and fearful name, yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these;then yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah will make thy plagues wonderful, and the plagues of thy seed, even great plagues, and of long continuance, and sore sicknesses, and of long continuance.moreover he will bring upon thee all the diseases of mizraim-narrows, which thou wast afraid of; and they cleave unto thee.also every sickness, and every plague, which is not written in the book of this teaching, them will yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah bring upon thee, until thou be destroyed.and ye be left few in number, whereas ye were as the stars of namespaces for multitude; because thou wouldest not obey the voice of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these.and it come to pass, that as yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah rejoiced over you to do you good, and to multiply you; so yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah will rejoice over you to destroy you, and to bring you to nought; and ye be plucked from off the land whither thou goest to possess it.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah scatter thee among all with-mum-people, from the one end of the earth even unto the other; and there thou work for other elohim-towards-these, which neither thou nor thy fathers have hand-known, even wood and father-child-stone.and among these nations thou find no ease, neither the sole of thy foot have rest: and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah give thee there a trembling heart, and failing of eyes, and sorrow of mind:and thy life hang in doubt before-turns thee; and thou fear day and night, and have none assurance of thy life:in the morning thou say, would elohim-towards-these it were even! and at even thou say, would elohim-towards-these it were morning! for the fear of thine heart wherewith thou fear, and for the sight of thine eyes which thou see.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah bring thee into mizraim-narrows again with ships, by the way whereof i spake unto thee, thou see it no more again: and there ye be sold unto your father-adversaries for workers and bondwomen, and no man buy you.these are the bee-words of the covenant, which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah order-prescribed mose-extracted to make with children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards in the land of moab-from-father, beside the covenant which he made with them in horeb-sword.and mose-extracted called unto all israel-saturated-towards, and said unto them, ye have seen all that yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah did before-turns your eyes in the land of mizraim-narrows unto pharaoh-big-house, and unto all his workers, and unto all his land;the great temptations which thine eyes have seen, the signs, and those great miracles:yet yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah hath not given you an heart to perceive, and eyes to see, and ears to hear, unto this day.and i have led you forty years in the place-of-word-desert: your clothes are not waxen old upon you, and thy shoe is not waxen old upon thy foot.ye have not eaten bread, neither have ye drunk wine-inherit or strong drink: that ye might hand-know that i am yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah your elohim-towards-these.and when ye came unto this place, sihon-curly the moloch-king of heshbon-score, and og-mock the moloch-king of bashan-at-tooth, came out against us unto battle, and we smote them:and we took their land, and gave it for an inheritance unto the reu-buddybenites, and to the gad-luckites, and to the half branch of manasseh-place-of-sleep.keep therefore the bee-words of this covenant, and do them, that ye may prosper in all that ye do.ye stand this day all of you before-turns yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah your elohim-towards-these; your captains of your branchs, your elders, and your officers, with all the men of israel-saturated-towards,your little ones, your women, and thy stranger that is in thy camp, from the hewer of thy wood unto the drawer of thy from-waters:that thou shouldest enter into covenant with yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these, and into his toward-oath, which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these maketh with thee this day:that he may establish thee to day for a with-mum-people unto himself, and that he may be unto thee a elohim-towards-these, as he hath said unto thee, and as he hath sworn unto thy fathers, to abraham-their-dick, to isaac-laughter, and to jacob-backstreet.neither with you only do i make this covenant and this toward-oath;and with him that standeth here with us this day before-turns yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah our elohim-towards-these, and also with him that is not here with us this day:(for ye hand-know how we have dwelt in the land of mizraim-narrows; and how we came through the nations which ye passed by;and ye have seen their thorny-abominations, and their heap-idols, wood and father-child-stone, silver and gold, which were among them:)lest there should be among you man, or woman, or family, or branch, whose heart turneth away this day from yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah our elohim-towards-these, to go and work for the elohim-towards-these of these nations; lest there should be among you a root that beareth gall and wormwood;and it come to pass, when he heareth the bee-words of this curse, that he knee-fluffy-bless himself in his heart, saying, i have peace, though i walk in the imagination of mine heart, to add drunkenness to thirst:yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah will not spare him, and then the nose-anger of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah and his jealousy smoke against that man, and all the curses that are written in this book lie upon him, and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah blot out his name from under namespaces.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah separate him unto bad out of all the branchs of israel-saturated-towards, according to all the curses of the covenant that are written in this book of the teaching:so that the generation to come of your children-betweens that rise up after you, and the stranger that come from a far land, say, when they see the plagues of that land, and the sicknesses which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah hath laid upon it;and that the whole land thereof is brimstone, and salt, and burning, that it is not sown, nor beareth, nor any grass groweth therein, like the overthrow of sodom-splint-blood, and gomorrah-sheaves, admah-earth, and zeboim-swollen, which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah overthrew in his nose-anger, and in his wrath:even all nations say, wherefore hath yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah done thus unto this land? what meaneth the heat of this great nose-anger?then men say, because they have forsaken the covenant of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah elohim-towards-these of their fathers, which he made with them when he brought them forth out of the land of mizraim-narrows:for they went and worked for other elohim-towards-these, and partook-shatakh them, elohim-towards-these whom they hand-knew not, and whom he had not given unto them:and the nose-anger of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah was kindled against this land, to bring upon it all the curses that are written in this book:and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah rooted them out of their land in nose-anger, and in wrath, and in great indignation, and cast them into another land, as it is this day.the secret things belong unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah our elohim-towards-these: and those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children-betweens for ever, that we may do all the bee-words of this teaching.and it come to pass, when all these things are come upon thee, the knee-fluffy-blessing and the curse, which i have set before-turns thee, and thou call them to mind among all the nations, whither yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these hath driven thee,and return unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these, and obey his voice according to all that i order-prescribe thee this day, thou and thy children-betweens, with all thine heart, and with all thy being;that then yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these will turn thy captivity, and have compassion upon thee, and will return and gather thee from all the nations, whither yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these hath scattered thee.if any of thine be driven out unto the outmost parts of namespaces, from thence will yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these gather thee, and from thence will he fetch thee:and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these will bring thee into the land which thy fathers possessed, and thou possess it; and he will do thee good, and multiply thee above thy fathers.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these will scribe-circumcise thine heart, and the heart of thy seed, to love yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these with all thine heart, and with all thy being, that thou mayest live.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these will put all these curses upon thine father-adversaries, and on them that hate thee, which persecuted thee.and thou return and obey the voice of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, and do all his order-prescriptions which i order-prescribe thee this day.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these will make thee plenteous in every work of thine hand, in the fruit of thy body, and in the fruit of thy in-them-animal, and in the fruit of thy land, for good: for yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah will again rejoice over thee for good, as he rejoiced over thy fathers:if thou hearken unto the voice of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these, to keep his order-prescriptions and his statutes which are written in this book of the teaching, and if thou turn unto yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these with all thine heart, and with all thy being.for this order-prescription which i order-prescribe thee this day, it is not hidden from thee, neither is it far off.it is not in namespaces, that thou shouldest say, who go up for us to namespaces, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it, and do it?neither is it beyond the sea, that thou shouldest say, who go over the sea for us, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it, and do it?and the bee-word is very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth, and in thy heart, that thou mayest do it.see, i have set before-turns thee this day life and good, and death and bad;in that i order-prescribe thee this day to love yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these, to walk in his ways, and to keep his order-prescriptions and his statutes and his decision-grammars, that thou mayest live and multiply: and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these knee-fluffy-bless thee in the land whither thou goest to possess it.and if thine heart turn away, so that thou wilt not hear, and be drawn away, and partake-shatakh other elohim-towards-these, and work for them;i denounce unto you this day, that ye surely perish, and that ye not prolong your days upon the land, whither thou passest over jordan-its-going-down to go to possess it.i call namespaces and earth to record this day against you, that i have set before-turns you life and death, knee-fluffy-blessing and cursing: therefore choose life, that both thou and thy seed may live:that thou mayest love yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these, and that thou mayest obey his voice, and that thou mayest cleave unto him: for he is thy life, and the length of thy days: that thou mayest dwell in the land which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah sware unto thy fathers, to abraham-their-dick, to isaac-laughter, and to jacob-backstreet, to give them.and mose-extracted went and spake these bee-words unto all israel-saturated-towards.and he said unto them, i am an hundred and double-ten-twenty years old this day; i can no more go out and come in: also yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah hath said unto me, no go over this jordan-its-going-down.yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these, he will go over before-turns thee, and he will destroy these nations from before-turns thee, and thou possess them: and jesus-save-joshua, he go over before-turns thee, as yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah hath said.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah do unto them as he did to sihon-curly and to og-mock, moloch-kings of the amorite-talkers, and unto the land of them, whom he destroyed.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah give them up before-turns your face-turns, that ye may do unto them according unto all the order-prescriptions which i have order-prescribed you.be strong and of a good courage, fear not, nor be afraid of them: for yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these, he it is that doth go with thee; he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.and mose-extracted called unto jesus-save-joshua, and said unto him in the sight of all israel-saturated-towards, be strong and of a good courage: for thou must go with this with-mum-people unto the land which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah hath sworn unto their fathers to give them; and thou cause them to inherit it.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, he it is that doth go before-turns thee; he will be with thee, he will not fail thee, neither forsake thee: fear not, neither be dismayed.and mose-extracted wrote this teaching, and delivered it unto the dimmer-servers children-betweens of levi-join, which bare the cabinet of the covenant of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, and unto all the elders of israel-saturated-towards.and mose-extracted order-prescribed them, saying, at the end of every seven years, in the solemnity of the year of release, in the until-conception of dwellings,when all israel-saturated-towards is come to appear before-turns yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah thy elohim-towards-these in the stand-up-place which he choose, thou read this teaching before-turns all israel-saturated-towards in their hearing.gather the with-mum-people together, men and women, and children-betweens, and thy stranger that is within thy hair-gates, that they may hear, and that they may learn, and fear yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah your elohim-towards-these, and guard-observe to do all the bee-words of this teaching:and that their children-betweens, which have not hand-known any thing, may hear, and learn to fear yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah your elohim-towards-these, as long as ye live in the land whither ye go over jordan-its-going-down to possess it.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah said unto mose-extracted, behold, thy days approach that thou must die: call jesus-save-joshua, and present yourselves in the tent of until-conception, that i may give him a charge. and mose-extracted and jesus-save-joshua went, and presented themselves in the tent of until-conception.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah appeared in the dwelling in a page-column-erection of a cloud: and the page-column-erection of the cloud stood over the opening of the dwelling.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah said unto mose-extracted, behold, thou sleep with thy fathers; and this with-mum-people will rise up, and go a whoring after the elohim-towards-these of the strangers of the land, whither they go to be among them, and will forsake me, and break my covenant which i have made with them.then my nose-anger be kindled against them in that day, and i will forsake them, and i will hide my face-turns from them, and they be devoured, and many bads and troubles befall them; so that they will say in that day, are not these bads come upon us, because our elohim-towards-these is not among us?and i will surely hide my face-turns in that day for all the bads which they have wrought, in that they are turned unto other elohim-towards-these.now therefore write ye this song for you, and teach it children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards: put it in their mouths, that this song may be a witness for me against children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards.for when i have brought them into the land which i sware unto their fathers, that floweth with milk and honey; and they have eaten and filled themselves, and waxen fat; then will they turn unto other elohim-towards-these, and work for them, and provoke me, and break my covenant.and it come to pass, when many bads and troubles are befallen them, that this song testify against them as a witness; for it not be forgotten out of the mouths of their seed: for i hand-know their imagination which they go about, even now, before-turns i have brought them into the land which i sware.mose-extracted therefore wrote this song the same day, and taught it children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards.and he gave jesus-save-joshua child-between of nun-fish a charge, and said, be strong and of a good courage: for thou bring children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards into the land which i sware unto them: and i will be with thee.and it came to pass, when mose-extracted had made an end of writing the bee-words of this teaching in a book, until they were finished,that mose-extracted order-prescribed the levi-jointes, which conceived-of the cabinet of the covenant of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, saying,take this book of the teaching, and put it in the side of the cabinet of the covenant of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah your elohim-towards-these, that it may be there for a witness against thee.for i hand-know thy rebellion, and thy stiff neck: behold, while i am yet alive with you this day, ye have been rebellious to yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah; and how much more after my death?gather unto me all the elders of your branchs, and your officers, that i may speak these bee-words in their ears, and call namespaces and earth to record against them.for i hand-know that after my death ye will utterly corrupt yourselves, and turn aside from the way which i have order-prescribed you; and bad will befall you in the latter days; because ye will do bad in the sight of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, to provoke him to nose-anger through the work of your hands.and mose-extracted spake in the ears of all the until-witness of israel-saturated-towards the bee-words of this song, until they were ended.give ear, o ye namespacess, and i will speak; and hear, o earth, the bee-words of my mouth.my take-lessons drop as the rain, my speech distil as the dew, as the small rain upon the tender herb, and as the showers upon the grass:because i will publish the name of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah: ascribe ye greatness unto our elohim-towards-these.he is the rock, his work is perfect: for all his ways are decision-grammar: a elohim-towards-these of truth and without torment, just and right is he.they have corrupted themselves, their spot is not the spot of his children-betweens: they are a perverse and crooked generation.do ye thus requite yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, o foolish with-mum-people and unwise? is not he thy father that hath bought thee? hath he not made thee, and established thee?remember the days of old, consider the years of many generations: ask thy father, and he will show thee; thy elders, and they will tell thee.when the most high divided to the nations their inheritance, when he separated children-betweens of adam-earth-blood-man, he set the bounds of the with-mum-people according to the number of children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards.for yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah's portion is his with-mum-people; jacob-backstreet is the lot of his inheritance.he found him in a place-of-word-desert land, and in the waste howling place-of-word-desert; he led him about, he instructed him, he kept him as the apple of his eye.as an drop-eagle stirreth up her nest, fluttereth over her young, spreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them, beareth them on her wings:so yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah alone did lead him, and there was no strange elohim-towards-these with him.he made him ride on the high places of the earth, that he might eat the increase of the fields; and he made him to suck honey out of the rock, and name-from-oil out of the flinty rock;butter of kine, and milk of sheep, with fat of lambs, and ram-voicelesss of the breed of bashan-at-tooth, and intense-goats, with the fat of eliminate-kidneys of wheat; and thou didst drink the pure-tahor blood of the grape.and jeshurun-soaked waxed fat, and kicked: thou art waxen fat, thou art grown thick, thou art covered with fatness; then he forsook elohim-towards-these which made him, and lightly esteemed the rock of his saving.they provoked him to jealousy with strange elohim-towards-these, with abominations provoked they him to nose-anger.they butcherd unto devils, not to elohim-towards-these; to elohim-towards-these whom they hand-knew not, to new elohim-towards-these that came newly up, whom your fathers feared not.of the rock that begat thee thou art unmindful, and hast forgotten elohim-towards-these that formed thee.and when yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah saw it, he crave-abhorred them, because of the provoking of his children-betweens, and of his children-betweenesss.and he said, i will hide my face-turns from them, i will see what their end be: for they are a very froward generation, children-betweens in whom is no faith-training.they have moved me to jealousy with that which is not elohim-towards-these; they have provoked me to nose-anger with their vanities: and i will move them to jealousy with those which are not a with-mum-people; i will provoke them to nose-anger with a foolish nation.for a fire is kindled in mine nose-anger, and burn unto the lowest question-hell, and consume the earth with her increase, and set on fire the foundations of the mountains.i will heap mischiefs upon them; i will spend mine arrows upon them.they be burnt with hunger, and devoured with burning heat, and with bitter destruction: i will also send the teeth of beasts upon them, with the poison of serpents of the dust.the sword without, and terror within, destroy both the young man and the virgin, the suckling also with the man of gray gate-hairs.i said, i would scatter them into corners, i would make the remembrance of them to cease from inward men:were it not that i feared the wrath of the enemy, lest their adversaries should behave themselves strangely, and lest they should say, our hand is high, and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah hath not done all this.for they are a nation void of counsel, neither is there any understanding in them.o that they were wise, that they understood this, that they would consider their latter end!how should one chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight, except their rock had sold them, and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah had shut them up?for their rock is not as our rock, even our father-adversaries themselves being decides.for their vine is of the vine of sodom-splint-blood, and of the fields of gomorrah-sheaves: their grapes are grapes of gall, their clusters are bitter:their wine-inherit is the poison of dragons, and the cruel venom of asps.is not this laid up in store with me, and sealed up among my treasures?to me belongeth vengeance and recompence; their foot slide in due time: for the day of their calamity is at hand, and the things that come upon them make haste.for yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah decide his with-mum-people, and repent himself for his workers, when he seeth that their dynamic is gone, and there is none shut up, or left.and he say, where are their elohim-towards-these, their rock in whom they trusted,which did eat the fat of their butchers, and drank the wine-inherit of their pourings? let them rise up and help you, and be your protection.see now that i, even i, am he, and there is no elohim-towards-these with me: i kill, and i make alive; i wound, and i heal: neither is there any that can deliver out of my hand.for i lift up my hand to namespaces, and say, i live for ever.if i whet my glittering sword, and mine hand take hold on decision-grammar; i will render vengeance to mine father-adversaries, and will reward them that hate me.i will make mine arrows drunk with blood, and my sword devour flesh; and that with the blood of the slain and of the captives, from the beginning of revenges upon the enemy.rejoice, o ye nations, with his with-mum-people: for he will avenge the blood of his workers, and will render vengeance to his adversaries, and will be merciful unto his land, and to his with-mum-people.and mose-extracted came and spake all the bee-words of this song in the ears of the with-mum-people, he, and jesus-save-hoshea child-between of nun-fish.and mose-extracted made an end of speaking all these bee-words to all israel-saturated-towards:and he said unto them, set your hearts unto all the bee-words which i testify among you this day, which ye order-prescribe your children-betweens to guard-observe to do, all the bee-words of this teaching.for it is not a vain thing for you; because it is your life: and through this thing ye prolong your days in the land, whither ye go over jordan-its-going-down to possess it.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah spake unto mose-extracted that selfsame day, saying,get thee up into this mountain abarim-crossings-over, unto mount nebo-at-him, which is in the land of moab-from-father, that is over against jericho-moon-smell; and behold the land of canaan-mobile-trade, which i give unto children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards for a possession:and die in the mount whither thou goest up, and be added unto thy with-mum-people; as aaron-cabinet thy brother died in mount hor-mount, and was added unto his with-mum-people:because ye fire-nameed against me among children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards at the from-waters of meribah-jamkadesh, in the place-of-word-desert of zin-briar; because ye dedicated-finished me not in the midst of children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards.yet thou see the land before-turns thee; and no go thither unto the land which i give children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards.and this is the knee-fluffy-blessing, wherewith mose-extracted the man of elohim-towards-these knee-fluffy-blessed children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards before-turns his death.and he said, yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah came from )sinai-bush-(proto, and rose up from seir-hair-style unto them; he shined forth from mount paran-magnificence, and he came with ten thousands of dedicated-finisheds: from his right hand went a fiery teaching for them.yea, he loved the with-mum-people; all his dedicated-finisheds are in thy hand: and they sat down at thy feet; every one receive of thy bee-words.mose-extracted order-prescribed us a teaching, even the inheritance of the until-witness of jacob-backstreet.and he was moloch-king in jeshurun-soaked, when the heads of the with-mum-people and the branchs of israel-saturated-towards were added together.let reu-buddyben live, and not die; and let not his men be few.and this is the knee-fluffy-blessing of judah-know: and he said, hear, yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, the voice of judah-know, and bring him unto his with-mum-people: let his hands be sufficient for him; and be thou an help to him from his father-adversaries.and of levi-join he said, let thy thummim-naively-finished and thy urim-fires be with thy dedicated-finished one, whom thou didst prove at massa-loadh, and with whom thou didst strive at the from-waters of meribah-jam;who said unto his father and to his mother, i have not seen him; neither did he acknowledge his brethren, nor hand-knew his own children-betweens: for they have guard-observed thy bee-word, and kept thy covenant.they teach jacob-backstreet thy decision-grammars, and israel-saturated-towards thy teaching: they put incense before-turns thee, and whole on-up upon thine butcher-kitchen.knee-fluffy-bless, yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, his substance, and accept the work of his hands; hit through the loins of them that rise against him, and of them that hate him, that they rise not again.and of benjamin-he-between-of-righthand he said, the beloved of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah dwell in safety by him; and the base-lord cover him all the day long, and he dwell between-bin his shoulders.and of joseph-add he said, knee-fluffy-blessed of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah be his land, for the precious things of namespaces, for the dew, and for the deep that coucheth beneath,and for the precious fruits brought forth by the sun, and for the precious things put forth by the moon,and for the chief things of the ancient mountains, and for the precious things of the lasting hills,and for the precious things of the earth and fulness thereof, and for the good will of him that dwelt in the bush: let the knee-fluffy-blessing come upon the head of joseph-add, and upon the top of the head of him that was separated from his brethren.his heaviness is like the firstling of his bull, and his horn-rays are like the horn-rays of unicorns: with them he push the with-mum-people together to the ends of the earth: and they are the ten thousands of ephraim-fruitful, and they are the thousands of manasseh-place-of-sleep.and of zebulun-fertile he said, rejoice, zebulun-fertile, in thy going out; and, issachar-wage, in thy tents.they call the with-mum-people unto the mountain; there they inward butchers of being right: for they suck of the abundance of the seas, and of treasures hid in the sand.and of gad-luck he said, knee-fluffy-blessed be he that enlargeth gad-luck: he dwelleth as a gather-lion, and teareth the arm with the crown of the head.and he provided the first part for himself, because there, in a portion of the teachinggiver, was he seated; and he came with the heads of the with-mum-people, he executed the being right of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, and his decision-grammars with israel-saturated-towards.and of dan-discuss he said, dan-discuss is a gather-lion's whelp: he leap from bashan-at-tooth.and of naphtali-twisted he said, o naphtali-twisted, satisfied with favor, and full with the knee-fluffy-blessing of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah: possess thou the sea-west and the south-dry.and of asher-bliss he said, let asher-bliss be knee-fluffy-blessed with children-betweens; let him be acceptable to his brethren, and let him dip his foot in name-from-oil.thy shoes be iron and brass; and as thy days, so thy strength be.there is none like unto the elohim-towards-these of jeshurun-soaked, who rideth upon the namespaces in thy help, and in his excellency on the sky.the eternal elohim-towards-these is thy refuge, and underneath are the everlasting arms: and he thrust out the enemy from before-turns thee; and say, destroy them.israel-saturated-towards then dwell in safety alone: the fountain of jacob-backstreet be upon a land of corn-swimming and wine-inherit; also his namespacess drop down dew.happy art thou, o israel-saturated-towards: who is like unto thee, o with-mum-people saved by yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah, the shield of thy help, and who is the sword of thy excellency! and thine father-adversaries be found liars unto thee; and thou tread upon their high places.and mose-extracted went up from the plains of moab-from-father unto the mountain of nebo-at-him, to the top of pisgah-summit, that is over against jericho-moon-smell. and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah showed him all the land of gilead-roll-until-heap, unto dan-discuss,and all naphtali-twisted, and the land of ephraim-fruitful, and manasseh-place-of-sleep, and all the land of judah-know, unto the utmost sea,and the south-dry, and the plain of the valley of jericho-moon-smell, the light-city of palm trees, unto zoar-grief.and yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah said unto him, this is the land which i sware unto abraham-their-dick, unto isaac-laughter, and unto jacob-backstreet, saying, i will give it unto thy seed: i have caused thee to see it with thine eyes, and no go over thither.so mose-extracted the worker of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah died there in the land of moab-from-father, according to the bee-word of yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah.and he buried him in a valley in the land of moab-from-father, over against betpeor-house-gaping: and no man knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day.and mose-extracted was an hundred and double-ten-twenty years old when he died: his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated.and children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards wept for mose-extracted in the plains of moab-from-father thirty days: so the days of weeping and mourning for mose-extracted were ended.and jesus-save-joshua child-between of nun-fish was full of breath-spirit of wisdom; for mose-extracted had laid his hands upon him: and children-betweens of israel-saturated-towards hearkened unto him, and did as yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah order-prescribed mose-extracted.and there arose not a bringer since in israel-saturated-towards like unto mose-extracted, whom yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah hand-knew face-turns to face-turns,in all the signs and the wonders, which yhwh-aeiou-ohyeah sent him to do in the land of mizraim-narrows to pharaoh-big-house, and to all his workers, and to all his land,and in all that mighty hand, and in all the great terror which mose-extracted showed in the sight of all israel-saturated-towards.<br/>
