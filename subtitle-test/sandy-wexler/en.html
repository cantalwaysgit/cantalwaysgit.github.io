<br/>
[man 1] They said he was | out the door in two weeks. | <br/>
Then I hear the guy's re-upped | for five years. | <br/>
[man 2] The label hated it. | <br/>
[Kevin Nealon] This castle belongs | to the Duke of Gloucester. | <br/>
So I realize that was the guy who kept | angrily staring at me the whole time. | <br/>
-[laughs] | -[man] Hey, Kevin. Hey, Lorne. | <br/>
-You ready for this? | -Yeah, what's that? | <br/>
Oh, oh! We're gonna do the thing. Okay. | <br/>
All right, you want to start it off? | <br/>
-Talk to you, or talk to the lens? | -[man] Either way. | <br/>
So, Sandy Wexler... | <br/>
[smacks lips] Where do I begin? | <br/>
He may be the most unique guy I ever met. | <br/>
If you were working in Los Angeles | in the '90s, any time in there, | <br/>
you'd run into Sandy Wexler at some point. | <br/>
Sandy was one of those | fringe Hollywood managers | <br/>
that you always sort of saw around. | <br/>
You know, you'd see him at a wrap party, | and he'd be laughing, stuffing his face. | <br/>
You'd think, | "No one even invited this guy." | <br/>
Sandy said I could be | the next Patrick Swayze. [scoffs] | <br/>
Only thing he ever said to me | that made sense. | <br/>
Sandy was not a big shot. | He was a... He was a tiny shot. | <br/>
But anybody who met him, | you never forgot him. | <br/>
You know, you gotta remember | there was no YouTube, there was no Vines. | <br/>
And none of that... | None of the social media platforms. | <br/>
You really needed a guy like Sandy | to be seen. | <br/>
Not Sandy. | Not Sandy, but a guy like Sandy. | <br/>
[rock music playing] | <br/>
[blowing] | <br/>
Hey, Arsenio! | Nice to see you again, kiddo. | <br/>
Have I seen you before? | <br/>
[laughs] Yeah, it's Sandy Wexler. | <br/>
I met you at Bernie's beach house, | with Doug and Danny. | <br/>
You guys were playing hangman. | <br/>
You were hysterical that night. | No one could figure out the word "canoe." | <br/>
I have no idea | what you're talking about, man. | <br/>
How you doing with your manager, kid? | Are you still fighting? | <br/>
I don't have a manager, man. | <br/>
Well, you do now. If you want one. | <br/>
No, I'm good. I... I have an agent. | <br/>
-Oh. | -As a matter of fact, I have six agents. | <br/>
Got plenty of white people in my life. | <br/>
-All right. | -I'm good, dawg. | <br/>
An agent is business. A manager is family. | <br/>
He guides you. He advises you. | He fights the good fights. | <br/>
Makes the tough phone calls. | <br/>
Truth is, I'm not happy unless... | unless you're happy. | <br/>
So what do you say, Arsenio? | You wanna get happy together? | <br/>
Continued success, Arsenio! | <br/>
-[whooping] Okay? Oh! | -[pager beeping] | <br/>
I got a hit on the hip, and it's Sinbad. | <br/>
I don't think any of those people | were really beeping him. | <br/>
'Cause he would just go, like, | "Oh, jeez, Mackenzie Phillips." | <br/>
The one thing about Sandy is, | <br/>
-he just never stopped lying. | -Always. | <br/>
Managers get used to lying, | but Sandy took it to an art form. | <br/>
Where am I? I'm in Joel Silver's office | right now, talking about you. | <br/>
If you land on your feet-- | <br/>
Hey, buddy, how long are you gonna be? | <br/>
Excuse me, I am talking | to Lew Wasserman's neighbor right now. | <br/>
That was Janet Maslin from the Times. | <br/>
Sandy's personal life? | <br/>
-I know nothing. I know nothing. | -Did he have a personal life? | <br/>
-He wasn't married. | -Didn't date. | <br/>
It was sad. Seemed like he | didn't have any friends, right? | <br/>
He had no friends. | <br/>
Any good? | <br/>
[children laughing on film] | <br/>
[Sandy] No, no, no, no, no, no. | <br/>
[laughing] | <br/>
That's great. | <br/>
[stammering] But he was | the king of the fake laugh | <br/>
-and the applauding combo. Yeah. | -Combo. Yeah. | <br/>
[laughing] | <br/>
Next time he'll get his own ketchup. | <br/>
[laughs] | <br/>
You gotta go. | <br/>
Is Mary Jo Slater | the casting agent on this? | <br/>
-No. I don't know. | -Good job, guys. | <br/>
I was in Nam. | But, you know, I was there in 1984, | <br/>
so it was... It was a different vibe. | <br/>
[laughs] | <br/>
And then all I hear in the back is... | <br/>
[mimics Sandy laughing] | <br/>
-He would fake laugh at funny comics. | -That melon. | <br/>
It was like, "Why are you fake laughing? | <br/>
-It's Eddie Murphy. He's funny." | -[Dana Carvey] Right! | <br/>
When it came to eating | with Sandy, he, um... | <br/>
It was like a smorgasbord on his face. | <br/>
I mean, he was on the Atkins diet, right? | So he always had, like, chicken... | <br/>
-Kielbasa. | -T-bone steak. | <br/>
-Brisket. | -Beef jerky. | <br/>
I never actually ate with Sandy, | but I did hear it was kind of gross. | <br/>
[chewing loudly] | <br/>
Can you close your mouth | just a little bit? | <br/>
What did I do? | <br/>
He dressed like your grandfather, | <br/>
he had the table manners of a horse, | but he was a great manager. | <br/>
He really cared about his clients. | <br/>
He made them his family. | He was with them all the time. | <br/>
And, uh, I wasn't sure | what he was doing for them, | <br/>
but you could feel the love. | <br/>
I spoke to Chili's. I think I can | get us the corner table there | <br/>
and preorder the appetizers. | <br/>
I don't give a shit | about Chili's right now. | <br/>
I thought you wanted to go to Chili's. | <br/>
-No, I never said that. | -You said that. | <br/>
That's okay. | <br/>
You're nervous. | I can see that you're sweating. | <br/>
-I'm scared, Sandy. | -Yeah. | <br/>
I gotta jump over ten trailers | and land on a waterbed. | <br/>
[laughs] | <br/>
Why are you laughing? | <br/>
Because you're funny. | You make me laugh. | <br/>
-Well, I'm not trying to be funny. | -No, it's the way you said it. | <br/>
The way I said... | What are you... [sighs] | <br/>
Look at the size of this crowd. | <br/>
You said they'd come, and they came. | <br/>
Ladies and gentlemen | of El Segundo Motor Home Court, | <br/>
here to defy gravity, | <br/>
please let's welcome Wild Gary Roberts! | <br/>
-Rodgers! | -Rodgers! | <br/>
He said that. He said Rodgers. | <br/>
Yeah, 'cause I told him to! | <br/>
He said it the first time. | <br/>
I... I wish we could... | 'Cause he did say it the first time. | <br/>
-Stop talking. | -All right. I will. | <br/>
You get up there | and you show these people who you are. | <br/>
Gary Rodgers. | <br/>
It's Gary Rodgers. You said that, right? | <br/>
The second time. | <br/>
Yeah, but you knew it. | <br/>
Okay, guys, let's do this. | <br/>
[shouting indistinctly] | <br/>
What are you saying? | I don't know what you're... | <br/>
[continues shouting indistinctly] | <br/>
What are you pointing to? | I can only go forward. | <br/>
[shouting indistinctly] | <br/>
Oh, my God. | <br/>
He's really gonna jump | over all those trailers? | <br/>
Sir, my client is the best daredevil | trapeze artist in the world. | <br/>
Thank you very much. | <br/>
[breathes heavily] Let's go. | <br/>
Yeah! | <br/>
-What? | -[screeching] | <br/>
[screaming and grunting] | <br/>
[lands heavily] | <br/>
-[Gary groans] | -Oh, shit! | <br/>
-Jesus Christ! | -[laughing] | <br/>
[straining] Sandy. | <br/>
-He had this one guy, Ted Rafferty... | -Oh, yeah. | <br/>
...who was a, you know, puppet act. | Not that good. Like, a middle act. | <br/>
He believed in him. | He thought he was the greatest. | <br/>
He's like, "I'm gonna make him | the next Mr. Buttons." | <br/>
[people laughing] | <br/>
So, uh, Charlie, | have you always been a puppet? | <br/>
Well, I don't know. | Have you always been a parade float? | <br/>
[scattered laughter] | <br/>
[Ted] I'm just trying | to get to know you better, that's all. | <br/>
[Charlie] Know me better? | I'm sitting on your lap. | <br/>
[audience laughing] | <br/>
No, but seriously, | what's it like being a puppet? | <br/>
Well, I come from a long line of puppets. | <br/>
My father was a puppet. | My father's father was a puppet. | <br/>
Really? Was your father's father's | father a puppet? | <br/>
[laughing] | <br/>
Wait for the punch line, buddy. | <br/>
[all laughing] | <br/>
Somebody call JCPenney. | One of the mannequins is on the loose. | <br/>
[all laughing] | <br/>
Sir, have you ever had | a date in your life? | <br/>
Actually, I have. | <br/>
Your Anita Bryant poster doesn't count. | <br/>
[all laughing] | <br/>
But honestly, sir, | how long have you been dead for? | <br/>
[all laughing] | <br/>
Where do you come up with this stuff? | I wish you didn't. | <br/>
That was hysterical. | <br/>
So you caught the whole show, then? | <br/>
I saw every word of it. | It was sensational. | <br/>
I saw you come in late! | <br/>
Nah. Nah, I was there the whole time. | <br/>
Will you get a load of this bullcrap. | <br/>
I was. I was. | <br/>
Hey, hey, hey, hey, | now, guys, guys, please. | <br/>
All right. Sandy, I... I believe you. | <br/>
Thank you, Ted. | <br/>
And I was thinking, you'd do so well now | with the beach theater crowd. | <br/>
And you've got the once a month gig | opening for Fred Travalena at the Trop. | <br/>
I don't wanna lose that. | <br/>
It might be time | to move on to the next level. | <br/>
Kicking the piss out of you? | <br/>
No. Television. | <br/>
But... [scoffs] | <br/>
I don't know the first thing | about the TV business. | <br/>
That's why you got me. | <br/>
-I know my way around the networks. | -Liar! | <br/>
Hey, I've had a relationship | with CBS since 1965 | <br/>
when I was a PA on Gilligan's Island. | <br/>
Now, look, kids love the puppets. | And I know there's an audience for that. | <br/>
Mmm, maybe. | <br/>
Well, what about this? | <br/>
I know it's out of left field, | but how about a show for kids? | <br/>
Yeah, I was just saying that. | <br/>
So we agree. | <br/>
My favorite thing about Sandy | is where he lived. | <br/>
The place was a palace. | <br/>
[Henry] He lived | on the biggest property in Bel Air. | <br/>
[actor] Yeah. | <br/>
[Tony] Gorgeous pool. | <br/>
[Jay] One of the finest collections | of luxury cars I've ever seen. | <br/>
Make sure you hydrate, Yoshi! | It's a hot day! | <br/>
[Tony] Of course, | none of it belonged to Sandy. | <br/>
It was owned by some Jewish Iranian... | <br/>
The guy never even set foot | in the United States. | <br/>
...who needed Sandy there | for legal reasons. | <br/>
And he was not allowed in the main house. | <br/>
He was in the cabana by the pool. | <br/>
-[dog barking and growling] | -No, no, no, no. | <br/>
Oh, no! Oh, no, no! | No, no, no! | <br/>
Stay! Stay! Stay! | <br/>
I've lived here for four years already. | You should know me by now. | <br/>
Get to see the face. | The king of Hollywood. | <br/>
Do you understand me? | <br/>
-[Amy] Sandy? | -Ahh! | <br/>
Oh. Hi, uh, Amy. | Hi, Donna and Kendra. | <br/>
-Lola. | -Jesse. | <br/>
Yeah, that's right. | Wow, they're getting sharp. | <br/>
What brings you all the way out here | from Tarzana? | <br/>
Well, you said you'd watch the kids | while I go on the audition. | <br/>
Is that still okay? | <br/>
Oh, don't be silly. Of course. | We're gonna have a good time, guys. | <br/>
I have to get it, Sandy. | <br/>
I'm working two jobs | just to tread water out here. | <br/>
You're the quintessential American mother. | Oscar Mayer would be crazy to pass on you. | <br/>
Oscar Mayer? I thought I was auditioning | to play a hooker in a Wes Craven movie. | <br/>
You know what? My doctor put me | on a new thyroid medicine. | <br/>
He said it might make me foggy, | and I guess he was right. | <br/>
-Okay, Sandy, I'm gonna go. | -Yeah. | <br/>
Girls, be nice to Mr. Wexler. Okay? | <br/>
Yes, Mommy. | <br/>
-Oh, we're gonna have fun, guys. | -Okay. | <br/>
-Go get 'em, kid. Go get 'em. | -Okay. | <br/>
Oh, there's dogs out there. They-- | <br/>
Hey! Hi, guys. Hi, sweet girl. Hi. | <br/>
So what are you shmegegges up for? | <br/>
I have the original script | of On Golden Pond. | <br/>
Do you wanna read that out loud? | <br/>
No? | <br/>
What would you like to do? | <br/>
Go swimming? | <br/>
No, no, no. | That could get me kicked out of here. | <br/>
I thought you were the king of Hollywood? | <br/>
I never said that. | <br/>
-You said it to the dogs. | -Like a minute ago. | <br/>
No, I didn't. | <br/>
You guys like roller coasters? | <br/>
-Unbelievable. | -[girls screaming] | <br/>
Rifkin left Triad and he's joining forces | with Zifkin over at William Morris. | <br/>
After I was promoted out of the mailroom | at MCA, I was assigned to Frank Gorshin. | <br/>
And Frank Gorshin used to have me | hand-wash the Riddler costume, | <br/>
because he felt washing machines | might stretch out the material. | <br/>

Excuse me. | You were fantastic up there. | <br/>
-Oh, thanks. You're sweet. | -Yeah. | <br/>
It's corny, but it's fun. | <br/>
Corny? That had an edge to it. | I'm Sandy Wexler. | <br/>
Courtney. Nice to meet you. | <br/>
I just... I couldn't keep | my eyes off you up there. | <br/>
Please don't hit on me | in front of your kids. That's creepy. | <br/>
-He's not our dad. | -No, I'm not. | <br/>
He's the king of Hollywood. | <br/>
She thinks I said that to the dogs, | but I didn't. | <br/>
Listen, can we talk somewhere? | I'm a talent manager. | <br/>
I kinda gotta go. | We have a show every 12 minutes. | <br/>
It'll take four minutes of your time. | It'll be worth it. | <br/>
...someone who advises you, | someone who guides you, | <br/>
who makes the tough phone calls, | fights the big fights. | <br/>
Atkins. | <br/>
I mean, your voice, | <br/>
it sounds like a... | a bird and an angel had a baby. | <br/>
And you just so happen to be beautiful. | <br/>
You can't teach beautiful. | <br/>
If you could, I'd be in class right now, | believe me. [laughs] | <br/>
I'm telling you, you could be somebody. | <br/>
Come on. If I was gonna be anybody, | I'd be her by now. | <br/>
Everybody's gotta start somewhere. | <br/>
Buddy Hackett was a dishwasher | in the Catskills till he was 60. | <br/>
Barbra Streisand started | as a backup singer in a petting zoo. | <br/>
Liza Minnelli used to sing in a coal mine. | <br/>
Wasn't her mother Judy Garland? | <br/>
No, that's made up. | <br/>
[stammers] The mightiest tornado | starts with a small breeze. | <br/>
You sound like a fortune cookie. | <br/>
I used to represent a guy | who wrote fortune cookies. | <br/>
[scoffs] Get out of here. | <br/>
Yeah, he wrote for Happy Days | and fortune cookies. | <br/>
Let me ask you something. | <br/>
Why do you do what you do? | <br/>
I don't know. | <br/>
The only time I really feel alive | is when I'm singing. | <br/>
Well, imagine if you were singing | on stage in front of 50,000 people. | <br/>
You think you'd feel alive then? | <br/>
Up there singing like a bird | and an angel had a baby? | <br/>
You like the bird and angel thing, | don't you? | <br/>
I said that already? | <br/>
-Can I ask you something? | -Please do. | <br/>
Can you get any of that food | in your mouth? | <br/>
So you're saying I should quit right now | and leave with you? | <br/>
You're too big for this duck pond. | It's time to fly. | <br/>
[chuckles] | <br/>
You like to make trouble, | don't you, Sandy? | <br/>
What do you say? Wanna team up? | <br/>
I'll tell you what I told Josh Gelfand | in the sixth grade | <br/>
-when he asked me to the spring social. | -Uh-huh. | <br/>
I'd love to, | but we gotta ask my dad first. | <br/>
[girls] Ooh! | <br/>
[laughs] | <br/>
[Courtney] I guess I should have mentioned | my Dad's in Seward, Alaska. | <br/>
[Sandy] Oh, that's fine. I love it there. | <br/>
It's beautiful. | <br/>
-Oh, you've been? | -No, I haven't been there. | <br/>
-But you just said-- | -No, I didn't. | <br/>
[Courtney] I guess I should have also | mentioned the prison thing. | <br/>
[Sandy] Are you kidding? | <br/>
-I was in prison my entire childhood. | -[sighs] | <br/>
An emotional prison. | That's a life sentence, I'm telling you. | <br/>
-The Yugo, imported from France. | -[Courtney] Isn't it from Yugoslavia? | <br/>
[Sandy] No. "You go" to France. | "You go" and have a good time. Bonjour. | <br/>
-[door alarm buzzing] | -[indistinct announcement over PA] | <br/>
Hey, Poppy. | <br/>
How you doing? | <br/>
Oh, it's always a great day | when I see my little girl. | <br/>
Mr. Clarke, truly a pleasure. | Sandy Wexler of Wexler Artists. | <br/>
Is this the fool that want to manage you? | <br/>
Um, yes, I did come up here | to talk to you about that. | <br/>
[stammering] And if you're available | to speak, you know, and now's the time, | <br/>
I would love to have | a conversation about this. | <br/>
If we could conversate, I'm here to-- | <br/>
What about Six Flags Magic Mountain? | <br/>
I mean, she got benefits, | a paycheck every week. | <br/>
That mountain is truly magical. | <br/>
No, it is. | <br/>
I just, with all due respect, | I think your daughter has the magic. | <br/>
With her talent, | she could have a dream-come-true life. | <br/>
You mean, better than all of this? | <br/>
-[laughs] | -[scoffs] | <br/>
What? | <br/>
Dad. | <br/>
Who else have you managed? | <br/>
You ever hear of Indiana Jones? | <br/>
You work with Harrison Ford? | <br/>
No, but I do represent the guy | <br/>
who got his heart pulled out of his chest | in Temple of Doom. | <br/>
I love that guy. | <br/>
Everybody does. | <br/>
I don't know anything | about show business, Sandy. | <br/>
How do I know if I can trust you? | <br/>
Because I can look you dead in the eye | and promise you this: | <br/>
I will always do what's best | for your daughter. | <br/>
Well, okay. In that case... | <br/>
♪ You got a new manager ♪ | <br/>
♪ Thank you, Daddy ♪ | <br/>

You guys want to go out and celebrate? | <br/>
I can't go nowhere. | <br/>
Oh, that's right. I'm sorry. | Please don't shiv me. | <br/>
Shiv you? Man, I ain't no inmate. I work | here. I've got... got the night shift. | <br/>
What the... What? | <br/>
Got ya. | <br/>
Oh! Ha! | <br/>
Very good. | <br/>
Darling, you should take Sandy out | for a dinner and a show, Alaskan style. | <br/>
-[Sandy] That's amazing. | -[Courtney] Right? | <br/>
So good. | <br/>
The northern lights | and my new friend Sandy. | <br/>
That's as good as it gets. | <br/>
Northern lights are something else. | <br/>
I was actually talking | about the burger, though. | <br/>
-Is this bison, or is it moose meat? | -[laughing] | <br/>
[stammers] What's making it so good? | <br/>
It's a hamburger, crazy man. | <br/>
-A hamburger? | -And you're missing out without the bun. | <br/>
Now, the bun... | <br/>
If I lose five more pounds, | it's back to the buns. | <br/>
Oh, my God. | <br/>
[sighs] | <br/>
So you really think I could be somebody? | <br/>
-You are going straight to the top. | -Yeah? | <br/>
Up there | with all the other beautiful stars. | <br/>
Show me which star I am. | <br/>
-You wanna know which star you are? | -Yeah. | <br/>
Let's see. | <br/>
You are that one right there. | <br/>
[Courtney] Sandy, that's an airplane. | <br/>
I know. I told you, you were going places. | <br/>
-That's real smooth, Sandy. | -Thank you. | <br/>
You must be a real lady-killer. | <br/>
Listen, | <br/>
if we're gonna do business together, | we gotta have boundaries. | <br/>
I'm sorry, | but I learned that the hard way. | <br/>
A bad breakup? | <br/>
His name was Alfred. | <br/>
Oh, you're gay! | <br/>
I can see that now. | <br/>
No, I'm not gay as far as I know. | <br/>
-Alfred was my first client. | -Mmm-hmm. | <br/>
More than that. | He was... He was my best friend. | <br/>
Did he die? | <br/>
No, no. | <br/>
He got famous, and he, uh... | and he dumped me. | <br/>
That dick! | <br/>
He wasn't a dick. | I was the dick. It was my fault. | <br/>
I let the friendship | get in the way of the business. | <br/>
Now understand it's show business, | not show friendship. Right? | <br/>
That is so sad. | <br/>
It's not sad. It's actually a good thing. | <br/>
Because I got a stable of talent | in Hollywood | <br/>
that I, quite frankly, | think is the best of the bunch. | <br/>
And Eisner knows it, and Ovitch knows it. | <br/>
I'm sorry, | and I don't wanna toot my own horn | <br/>
'cause that's not what I like to do, | but toot-toot. | <br/>
Hmm. | <br/>
Best thing to me is I found you. | <br/>
I'm glad you found me. | <br/>
You're not as happy as I am. | Trust me. | <br/>
But we gotta get to work. | <br/>
Whenever Sandy signed a new client, | <br/>
he had a team of support people that | immediately began making over the client. | <br/>
He would just enroll everybody | in classes for the stuff they didn't do. | <br/>
Movement, martial arts... | <br/>
A posture person, and then a hair person. | <br/>
-And no one was better off after that. | -No. | <br/>
It was a train wreck. | <br/>
I'm not a dancer, Sandy. | <br/>
-It doesn't matter if you can't dance. | -It's all right. | <br/>
-Miss Gideon is gonna teach you to move. | -I got you, sweetheart. | <br/>
-It's about presence on stage. | -All right. That's enough, Sandy. | <br/>
-All right. Here we go. | -It's about being comfortable. | <br/>
-You know, Baryshnikov, I hear-- | -Shut it, Sandy. I got her. | <br/>
-["I'm Gonna Get You" playing] | -Who me? Who me? Who me? | <br/>
I'm a rock star. I'm a rock star. | <br/>
And pass the mic. Pass the mic. | Down the mic. Down the mic. | <br/>
[Sandy] That's it. That's it. | <br/>
-That's it. Now you're in it. | -[Gideon] Bobby Brown. | <br/>

-This girl can do it all. | -Feel it. And stop! | <br/>

-["U Can't Touch This" playing] | -[dancers exclaiming] | <br/>
[Sandy] Wonderful. | <br/>
[Yuri] Okay. Let's see it. | <br/>
-[shutter clicks] | -Very good. | <br/>
Very bad. | <br/>
Complete shit. | <br/>
You know what? I don't like the ice cream. | It's a bad idea. Looks terrible. | <br/>
Now let's go sexy, huh? | Can you give me some sexy, Courtney? | <br/>
Come on. | Let's put on some sexy music, Willow. | <br/>
["Shoop" playing] | <br/>
Okay. Yes. Let's shoop this shit. | Shoop it up, huh? | <br/>
Let's shoop the shoop. | Show me the sexy. Come on. | <br/>
Give me sexy. | <br/>
Honey, think of something sexy, huh? | <br/>
-Like what? | -Like moose burgers. | <br/>
-[chuckles] | -And there it is. Shoot that. | <br/>
Ah, Sandy likes it. No one knows why. | <br/>
Put your hand on your chin. | <br/>
Not like you're stroking a beard. | <br/>
Like you're thinking, | thinking filthy thoughts. | <br/>
Like wieners! | <br/>
Ah, that's good, Willow! | Wieners is good. You're brilliant today. | <br/>
Come on. Hand on chin, | thinking of wieners. | <br/>
I suck at this. | <br/>
-No, you don't. You're great. | -Oh, come on. | <br/>
It... You just... It's easy. | <br/>
Then you do it, Sandy. | <br/>
-Come on. Get over here. | -No, no, no, no. | <br/>
-You're a performer. I don't do that. | -Come on, Sandy. | <br/>
You said it's easy. | Dream of the wieners, huh? | <br/>
Come over here. Come on. | <br/>
Do I wear my glasses, | or do I take them off? Or... | <br/>
Nobody gives a shit. Come on. | <br/>
[chuckles] Eh... | <br/>
-You put your hand on the chin. | -Uh-huh. | <br/>
You just... You think. | <br/>
-[Courtney laughs] | -[chuckles] | <br/>
Huh? Just thinking. | Little more thinking over here. | <br/>
[Yuri] Yes, that's brilliant. | <br/>
Beautiful. Thank you, Sandy. | Clear out of frame. | <br/>
-Get out. | -No, I'm gonna miss him. | <br/>
No, you'll be fine. | Sexy will be right over here. | <br/>
-Don't worry. | -I'll be there. | <br/>
He's still got his hand on his chin. | He's so cute. | <br/>
Ah, that's much better. | <br/>
[Sandy] Yes, that's it. | <br/>
[Yuri] Yes, now I see sexy. | <br/>
["Shoop" continues playing] | <br/>
The definition of, like, a given | <br/>
is that kids wake up | and they think, "Me so horny." | <br/>
And then, you know, you don't need | a song that just reinforces, | <br/>
they know they're so horny. | <br/>
If it was, like, "Me So Introspective" | or something like that. | <br/>
Or "Me So Ambivalent" or... | <br/>
Just so good. | <br/>
Talk about fearless. Best in town by far. | <br/>
Isn't she? | <br/>
She? Who's she? | <br/>
What? | <br/>
-Did you call him? | -Yeah, I called him. | <br/>
What'd he say? | <br/>
-What'd who say? | -The guy you called. | <br/>
Who did I call? | <br/>
The guy from the Young Comedians Special. | <br/>
Oh, yeah. No, I gotta call him. | <br/>
-So you didn't call him? | -No, I called him. | <br/>
No, you didn't. | <br/>
I thought you called him. | <br/>
Sandy, you're making | even less sense than usual. | <br/>
No, I'm not. | <br/>
-Something's off. | -Off how? | <br/>
I don't know. Different. | <br/>
Did you dye your hair or something? | <br/>
I don't think so. | <br/>
Maybe it's a brain tumor. | <br/>
Maybe it is. | <br/>
-Anyway, can we run lines? | -Yeah, that's why I'm here. | <br/>
I need to know the truth, | you son of a bitch! | <br/>
All right, I dyed my hair. | Just the tips. You happy? | <br/>
No, the line, Sandy. | <br/>
I know. I was improvising. | <br/>
But you want this line? Um... | <br/>
"The truth? You wouldn't know the truth | if it bit you on the--" | <br/>
Bird. | <br/>
We gotta find a way. | Don't you think, Sandy? | <br/>
Sandy? | <br/>
A way? What way? | <br/>
A way to get rid of the birds. | <br/>
Yeah, a bird and a baby had an angel. | <br/>
Are you stoned or something? | <br/>
Stoned? I don't do pot. Come on. | <br/>
Well, you seem stoned out of your mind. | What's with the crazy smile? | <br/>
I don't know, I'm just smiling at the fact | you might become the new Captain Kangaroo. | <br/>
He's lying again. | <br/>
No, I'm not. I'm not lying. | <br/>
I've been thinking about how you | can work on your kid-friendly material. | <br/>
Maybe go to Magic Mountain. | <br/>
When you see all the children on line, | just start doing jokes for 'em. | <br/>
-See if it works. | -That feels very child molestery. | <br/>
He wants to ruin you. Fire him! | <br/>
Fire me? | If you're firing anybody, I'd fire him. | <br/>
He's useless. He does nothing. | <br/>
I do everything! What do you do? | <br/>
Guys, guys, guys! | Come on, we're on the same team here. | <br/>
-That's what I'm trying to tell him. | -Yes. | <br/>
Teammates? | <br/>
Yeah, thank you. | <br/>
[exclaims] | <br/>
-You took my arm! You took my arm! | -Oh, come off it. That's-- | <br/>
-You took my arm! | -That's not... | <br/>

No. I didn't know | they were gonna repeat it. | <br/>
-I never want to see that again! | -Well... | <br/>
I can't stop them, Kevin, legally, | 'cause we signed an agreement. | <br/>

[chuckles] Barry Bubatzi. | <br/>
Barry. | <br/>
[stammering] Yeah, I was | Carr D'Angelo's assistant? | <br/>
-Hiccups? That's you? | -Yeah. | <br/>
-Look at this. Hiccups. | -[laughs] Yeah. | <br/>
Bubatzi! | <br/>
He... he called me Hiccups | <br/>
because I had the hiccups this one time | I was on the phone with him. | <br/>
Well, listen, | he didn't just have the hiccups, | <br/>
-he had the hiccups. | -[both chuckle] | <br/>
-He wouldn't stop hiccupping. | -Yeah. | <br/>
Uh, you can die from hiccups. | I was terrified. | <br/>
I was actually concerned. | <br/>
-[both laugh] | -It was nerve-racking. A little bit. | <br/>
How's your sister? | Did she get into Penn State? | <br/>
-She just graduated. | -Another successful Bubatzi. | <br/>
-You see, that is why I love this guy. | -What? | <br/>
[stammers] He actually talked to me | when I was just an assistant. | <br/>
You treated me with respect, Sandy. | <br/>
-Not many people did. | -Well, of course. | <br/>
-This is my girl, Mary. | -Hi. | <br/>
Mary. Sandy Wexler. | <br/>
-Nice to meet you. | -Nice to meet you. | <br/>
Are you... | What happened to your arm? | <br/>
-Yeah, I got myself a tattoo. | -What'd you get? | <br/>
Uh... it is that of a dog bite. | <br/>
So how's Carr D'Angelo? | <br/>
Well, he, uh... he left. | He's working for Blockbuster Video now. | <br/>
Smart move. | The music business has its ups and downs, | <br/>
but Blockbuster Video's here | for the long haul. | <br/>
And you, what are you up to? | <br/>
I left, too. | <br/>
-I'm at Capitol Records now. | -Oh. | <br/>
He's head of A&amp;R. | <br/>
You know how happy that makes me? | <br/>
Hiccups Bubatzi goes big time. | <br/>
That's just... | That's the way it should be. | <br/>
You worked your ass off, kiddo. | <br/>
Can I talk business for a second? | Is that all right? | <br/>
I have a client that, actually, | you would love to meet-- | <br/>
-Tell you what... | -What? | <br/>
Call my office next week. Yeah. | <br/>
I mean, you sure? 'Cause I will call. | <br/>
-[laughs] I know. | -[laughs] | <br/>
-It was great seeing you, pal. | -It was great seeing you. | <br/>
And I hope, uh, | one of those dresses works out for you. | <br/>
-Oh, no, this isn't... | -[Mary] Cute. | <br/>
-[laughing] It was... I mean... | -So good. | <br/>
It's a Bubatzi world. We're all just-- | <br/>
Could you please | not block the whole aisle? | <br/>
We're all just living in it. | <br/>
I wasn't blocking the aisle. | <br/>
[Sandy] Wow. | <br/>
-Hi. | -Hey, neighbor. | <br/>
Hi, Cindy! | <br/>
Where's that | billionaire landlord of yours? | <br/>
Is he ever going to grace us | with his presence? | <br/>
[laughs] What a question. | <br/>
Listen, he's supposed to come out | for Rosh Hashanah, | <br/>
but he said last year Purim, | so who knows? | <br/>
-[laughs] | -But anyways, how are you? | <br/>
How is your husband? | <br/>
Doctors say it could be any day now. Hmm. | <br/>
Oh, I'm so sorry. It's just... | <br/>
How are you doing? | No one ever asks how you're doing. | <br/>
How you feeling? | <br/>
The truth is that I'm just... | <br/>
a little bit lonely. | <br/>
You were together so long. | Of course you're lonely. | <br/>
So if you ever see | my tennis court lights on at night... | <br/>
that means that I could use some company. | <br/>
-It was great to see you, Cindy. | -Bye, Sandy. | <br/>
Okay, we're gonna go. | All right. Good night, now. | <br/>
Good night. | <br/>
Look, Gary Rodgers can't make that jump | <br/>

There's dogs. There's dogs. | <br/>
A roach spray for birds. | <br/>
Tom, I'm sorry. | That's not my job. That's your job. | <br/>
That's why I'm telling you. | <br/>
I'm telling ya! | <br/>
Listen, don't do that to me! | I'll pull the plug on this thing! | <br/>
Do you hear me? | <br/>
All right. I'm sorry I got hot there, | Tom, but you weren't listening. | <br/>
Okay, here's a stock tip | for you to make up for that. | <br/>
Pull all your money out of Apple, | <br/>
'cause no one's using | the Macintosh anymore. | <br/>
Put 80% into small local bookstores, | the other 20% into Woolworth's. | <br/>
-Righto. | -[hangs up] | <br/>
-Look at you, Mr. Manager Man. | -You don't wanna yell at people, | <br/>
but sometimes | it's the only way they can hear. | <br/>
You look stunning. | <br/>
Well, this yard is the most amazing yard | I've ever seen, and that pool-- | <br/>
The pool's off-limits. House rules. | <br/>
So, Yuri stopped by my office. | <br/>
Yeah, I know. He's right there. | <br/>
You see him? Let's go over. | <br/>
[Yuri] We need to find the one | that expresses the right message. | <br/>
You know, "I'm fun. | I'm complicated. I'm sexy." | <br/>
I'm confused. I'm crazy. I'm embarrassed. | <br/>
You're beautiful is what you are. | Stop that. | <br/>
-[pager beeping] | -Got a hit on the hip. | <br/>
This is someone I actually have to call. | <br/>
Okay, I'll be back in a few seconds. | <br/>
Okay, cool, we'll be in the pool. | <br/>
-You stay out of the pool. | -[chuckles] | <br/>
I was just kidding. | <br/>
I know, and it was hysterical. | <br/>
But seriously, stay out of the pool. | <br/>
No, not you, Barry. Hi! | <br/>
-I don't know how you do it. | -Do what? | <br/>
Deal with all the crazy Sandy shit. | <br/>
-Man, he's such a-- | -Boner face? | <br/>
-I love that. | -He's not a boner face. | <br/>
-He's a badass. | -Okay. | <br/>
Well, listen, this girl is one | of the best singers you'll ever see, | <br/>
and the best, brightest person ever. | <br/>
I'm gonna go with the one | on the top right corner. | <br/>
And can you blow up... that one? | <br/>
Oh, my God. | <br/>
What? It's a good picture. | <br/>
Sandy already asked me to do that for him. | <br/>

No, no, no, wait! | We are not permitted in the pool! Okay? | <br/>
-Firuz forbids it. | -You're not in a cult, are you, Sandy? | <br/>
No, Firuz is my landlord. | <br/>
He does not allow us in the pool. | It is forbidden. | <br/>
No, no. All right! | <br/>
Ah! Don't you come any closer, Sandy. | I'll put my whole foot in, I swear. | <br/>
-No, no! | -[stammering] | <br/>
-Please don't... No! | -Ooh! | <br/>
No, I am not kidding you, Courtney. | I will let you go as a client. | <br/>
-I didn't wanna have to say that. | -[Ted] Oh, my God. | <br/>
Do not put your foot in the pool, | or the career is done. | <br/>
And I'm not... I'm not messing with you. | <br/>
-Oh, God. | -I don't care what you're saying. | <br/>
Whoa! | <br/>
Okay, you did it! You did it! | You did the foot. | <br/>
You did the foot. The foot is wet. | <br/>
Please come back in the house. | I'm asking nicely. | <br/>
I just don't have... I can't... | <br/>
I wasn't gonna go in. | <br/>
I know you weren't gonna go in. | <br/>
I... I can't joke, too? | <br/>
-Really? "I know you won't." | -I can't joke, too. | <br/>
Whoo! Cannonball! | <br/>
Whoo! | <br/>
[clients cheering] | <br/>
Maybe tomorrow. Maybe tomorrow, okay? | <br/>
Maybe I'll wear you tomorrow. | <br/>
And... and it's not you guys. | You're doing great. | <br/>
I love you guys. | I love you guys, all right? | <br/>
Good night. Good night, everybody. | <br/>

Don't "who's that" me, man. | <br/>
Why do you screw Firuz? | <br/>
-Firuz? | -Yes. | <br/>
I don't see you. | Show your face! | <br/>
I'm in Tehran, you imbecile. | <br/>
I tell you to stay out of my pool, | and what do you do? | <br/>
You go in my pool. | <br/>
Uh, nobody went in your pool. | No, no, who told you that? The dogs? | <br/>
I have cameras everywhere, man. | I'm watching you all the time. | <br/>
You're much better | than anything we have on Iranian TV. | <br/>
I see you with bacon over the sink, | <br/>
I see you fall asleep in my chair, | watching my Cinemax. | <br/>
And I see your godless friends in my pool! | <br/>
No, no, listen, Firuz. | Here's what happened. | <br/>
There was an earthquake in Los Angeles. | <br/>
So we just went in the pool | 'cause it's the safest place to be. | <br/>
But we didn't go all the way in. | No water was touched. | <br/>
Sandy, you lie all the time, man. | It's embarrassing. | <br/>
I wish I was lying. I wish I was. | <br/>
And how many times are you going to | listen to that one song, my friend? | <br/>
I mean, mix in a little | Miami Sound Machine or something. | <br/>
It's a client of mine. Courtney Clarke. | <br/>
What, you don't like it? | <br/>
The song is good, and I like her, too. | <br/>
You know, when she was in bathroom, | I got quite a good look at her. | <br/>
-You what? | -Firuz joking. [chuckles] | <br/>
I don't have cameras | in bathroom anymore. | <br/>
I had them taken out | when you had the big hemorrhoid. | <br/>
That wasn't a hemorrhoid, | that was a fissure. | <br/>
But, Sandy, people in my pool, | this I do not like! | <br/>
-I-- | -That's strike one, Sandy! | <br/>
I'm telling you-- | <br/>
-You don't want to get strike two. | -I... I agree. | <br/>
-Goodbye from Firuz. | -[static] | <br/>
Bye-bye. | <br/>
You know, I did tell them not to go | in the pool, and they did it anyway. | <br/>
-So you admit it? | -No! I-- | <br/>
Strike two! Firuz knows everything. | <br/>
[Firuz laughs maniacally] | <br/>
[Sandy] Okay, | what are we doing today, big guy? | <br/>
We going to Jerry's? | Or you want to go to Carney's? | <br/>
I can go either one. | <br/>
It's all good for the Atkins. | I can get a frankfurter, no bun. | <br/>
-I know. | -I can get a plate of roast beef... | <br/>
-or corn beef-- | -Don't go over the whole menu. | <br/>
I don't give a shit about your roast beef. | <br/>
Stu Smiley passed on me | for the Young Comedians Special. | <br/>
-That's right. He... | -I don't even believe it. | <br/>
-He's a moron. | -He's not a moron. | <br/>
He's a pompous know-it-all, | smarmy little Ivy League pussy. | <br/>
-He went to San Diego State... actually. | -You're kidding me right now, right? | <br/>
You corrected me | 'cause he went to San Diego State? | <br/>
No, I'm agreeing with you. | <br/>
I'm saying you are too smart | and too topical to be on HBO. | <br/>
They like young and stupid. | <br/>
-They like cute and moronic. | -Yes. | <br/>
-Nothing challenging, nothing unfamiliar. | -No. | <br/>
-They want some, like, ex-Florida DJ... | -Ha! | <br/>
...who's blandly handsome, | <br/>
and his little gimmicks, his voice cracks | on the punch line or he's... | <br/>
Pretends to be tripping | on acid the whole set. | <br/>

Chinese food? | <br/>
I don't want Chinese food for lunch. | <br/>
All right, beef and broccoli. | <br/>
This conversation goes a lot better | when it's just me talking. | <br/>
-I'm not in the conversation? | -Oh, you are, but you aren't. | <br/>
You can let... Blast off on me. Go ahead. | Yell at me as much as you want. | <br/>
As long as you promise to bring it | on the stage with you tonight, | <br/>
-and you show HBO... | -I promise. | <br/>
...they don't need to discover you. | <br/>
Kevin Connors will discover himself. | Thank you very much. | <br/>
What does that even mean? | How do I discover myself? | <br/>
Do you know how dumb that sounds? | <br/>
That's one of the... Don't click. | Why're you clicking? Stop clicking! | <br/>

Excuse me, miss? Oh, wow. Hi. | <br/>
Oh, my God, I know you. | <br/>
-She knows me. | -Hey. Yeah. | <br/>
Didn't you get one star | on Star Search the other day? | <br/>
-No. | -[stammers] | <br/>
This... What station are you listening to? | The number? | <br/>
-What? | -The station you're listening to? | <br/>
You need to enunciate. | I can't understand what you are saying. | <br/>
No, no, what is the dial number? | <br/>
What are you tripping about, bro? | <br/>
I'm asking you | what station you're listening to! | <br/>
Don't you... What are you... | <br/>
Good job. You scared her off. | <br/>

[stammering] | <br/>
-Well, it works! | -[chuckles] | <br/>
What are we doing tonight to celebrate? | You were on the radio! | <br/>
Hmm. Well, Bling just called, | <br/>
and Quincy Jones invited me | to his party tonight. | <br/>
-Jonesy? Jonesy's having a party? | -Okay. Uh-huh. | <br/>
I heard he was gonna have a... | <br/>
-I just didn't know when. | -Oh. | <br/>
So what? | Did you get a plus-one or... | <br/>
Yes, plus-one. | <br/>
-And I'm the one? | -[chuckles] Yeah. | <br/>
You know, I met his grandmother | years ago at a Hamburger Hamlet. | <br/>
She calls him Quincelius. | <br/>
So every time I see him, | I say, "Hi, Quincelius." | <br/>
He gives me a look like, | "How did he know?" | <br/>
Okay, cool. | So should we go to the party? | <br/>
You wanna go to it? | Why shouldn't... Let's pop by. | <br/>
He lives in Venice, right? | <br/>
Uh... no, the address is in Bel Air. | <br/>
Oh, so he moved? Okay, okay, he moved. | <br/>
-[music playing on speakers] | -[indistinct chatter] | <br/>
Sandy Wexler. Wow. | <br/>
They let you in this party? | <br/>
Hey, Bronstein. | <br/>
You heard you didn't get into | Hillcrest Country Club, right? | <br/>
Yeah, I heard. | <br/>
[sighs] This place is incredible! | <br/>
Yeah, it's nice. It's nice. | <br/>
His one in Venice wasn't trying as hard. | <br/>
Quincy never lived in Venice. | What you talking about, Willis? | <br/>
What? No, she said he did. | <br/>
-What? | -She? Oh! | <br/>
I'm a huge fan. I'm Arsenio. | <br/>
I know, Arsenio. Courtney. | <br/>
Hey, Arsenio. Good to see you. | I'm Sandy Wexler, her manager. | <br/>
You remember? We met at, uh... | at Bernie's beach house. | <br/>
Your manager look like he fell down | an elevator shaft. What's up? | <br/>
No, no, no. I, uh... Fender bender. | You should see the other guy. | <br/>
-Oh, he got hurt? | -Who did? | <br/>
-The other guy? | -What? No. | <br/>
You know what? | I heard your new song, "Mr. DJ." | <br/>
I love it. It's off the chain. | You've gotta come on the show and do it. | <br/>
-I would love to. | -Oh, well, listen. | <br/>
I got a call from Johnny Carson | today, actually. | <br/>
He heard the song as well on the radio, | and he booked her on the show next week. | <br/>
Carson? | <br/>
Well, congratulations. | <br/>
You ever need me, Stage 29. | I'll be there forever, baby. | <br/>
Ah, thanks, Arsenio. | No, I didn't mean any problem-- | <br/>
You didn't tell me | I was doing Carson next week! | <br/>
That was a negotiation ploy. | I may have overplayed my hand there. | <br/>
Carson retired two years ago. | <br/>
Sandy Wexler? | Somebody hide the pastrami. | <br/>

Hey, thank you. Good to see you, too. | <br/>
Wow. Look at all these awards he has. | <br/>
You'll have more one day. | <br/>

No, this was a high-impact | Tae Bo class I took. It's fine. | <br/>
Okay. | <br/>
How about our girl here | getting the radio play, huh? | <br/>
Did I tell you she's a superstar or what? | <br/>
Oh, yeah, she's getting some heat. | <br/>
-Yeah, we'll see where it goes. | -Thanks, Bling. | <br/>
Excuse me. Excuse me, Shortie Doo-Wop, | can I get two Zimas and for Sandy... | <br/>

-Amy Baskin. | -Sandy, what are you doing here? | <br/>
I was invited. | Thank you very much. Hi. | <br/>
Bling, I want you to meet Amy Baskin. | <br/>
To me, she is the next Grace Kelly. | <br/>
-I'm trying. | -Amy? Courtney. | <br/>
Remember me from the ritual pool party? | <br/>
Oh, my God. I heard your song | on the radio twice today. | <br/>
-Congratulations, Courtney. | -Oh, well, we got a great manager. | <br/>
He told me to always sing from the heart. | <br/>
And I tell this girl, | "Always act from the heart." | <br/>
Hey, did we get the offer on | the Mentos commercial I was on hold for? | <br/>
No, you weren't on hold for it. | What I said was, | <br/>
"I called them and they put me on hold | for about 45 minutes." | <br/>
But when they... they got on the phone, | they told me they passed on you. | <br/>
-Well, there you go. | -No, it's good. | <br/>
They said she had a great reading. | <br/>
That it truly looked like | she loved the Mentos. | <br/>
I'll be back with your drinks. | <br/>
-[Sandy] Okay. | -Okay. | <br/>
Yo, check it out. It's OJ Simpson, | Phil Spector and Robert Blake. | <br/>
Good guys. | Call 'em the dream team. [laughs] | <br/>
-I'm gonna go chop it up with 'em. | -All right. | <br/>

-Who's Jonesy? | -Quincy? | <br/>
-Oh, Quincy? You wanna see, uh... | -Yeah. | <br/>

All right. Let's get that done. | <br/>
-You think he's around? | -Yeah, it'll be good to see him again. | <br/>

What do you think? | <br/>
Mmm! This is so good, Mr. Jones. | <br/>
What do you think, Sandy? | You like it? | <br/>
[smacking lips] | <br/>
What's the matter, man? | <br/>
Nothing. No, I think it's good. | <br/>
It's... it's... It's just grapey. | <br/>
-What do you mean "grapey"? | -Oh, I... I didn't say it was a bad thing. | <br/>
Okay. I'm gonna try | to respect your opinion, brother. | <br/>
Let me try another one. | I've got a '61 Château Pétrus downstairs. | <br/>
Okay. | <br/>
I paid eight grand for it | at the Côte de Nuits. | <br/>
-Yeah, okay. | -That's too much. No. | <br/>
Pretty sure this'll get your attention. | <br/>
Thank you, Quincelius. | <br/>
Who the hell is Quincelius? | <br/>
Nobody. Come on. What are we doing here? | <br/>
Thank you. | <br/>
It was grapey. It was a little grapey. | <br/>
-I think you offended him. | -No, I didn't. | <br/>
I thought it was cool. | <br/>
When he comes back, | I dare you to say you hate that one, too. | <br/>
-What? | -[chuckles] | <br/>
The man spent $8,000 on the wine. | He'll kill me. | <br/>
Oh, we'll laugh our asses off. Come on. | <br/>
-Courtney, what do you got me doing here? | -I was saving this for a special occasion. | <br/>
I think this is special enough. | <br/>

You'll have to let me know | what you think, baby. | <br/>
Yeah. Thank you. | <br/>
Very much. | <br/>
What do you think, honey? | <br/>
Mr. Jones, this is exquisite. | <br/>
And, Sanford, you likey? | <br/>
-Honestly? | -What else, man? | <br/>
-It's a little nutty. | -Nutty? | <br/>

I'm having a hard time seeing. | My glasses are blurry from the wine toss. | <br/>
[Jones] Get out! | <br/>
You know what? This is probably it. | I... I'm gonna go. | <br/>
-Leave! | -Courtney! Okay. | <br/>
Hey. Thank you, Q-bert. | It was a great night. | <br/>
-[laughs] Did you see the way that was-- | -You made me do that! You! | <br/>
-How are we getting out? | -Are you happy? | <br/>

What? Who's calling you? | <br/>
I don't know. | <br/>
I've been dealing with this | ever since I moved into this place. | <br/>
-Are your doors locked? | -Yeah. | <br/>
You stay inside. I'll be right there. | <br/>
You're in trouble now, tough guy! | <br/>
Look what I've been carrying | around in my backseat... | <br/>
ever since I was attacked | on Ventura Place. | <br/>
Huh? You like this? | <br/>
You wanna... You wanna feel it? | <br/>
Come out! Where are you? | <br/>
-Courtney, stay in the house! | -[twig snaps] | <br/>

[scoffs] No way. | <br/>
I'm telling you, you'll never have to | worry about him again, though. | <br/>
You didn't kill him, did you? | <br/>
No. No. Uh, I... | <br/>
I seen him go out into the forest again | to see his family, so... | <br/>
All right? But I screamed at him. | <br/>
I let him know, "Don't come back here. | You stay with the... | <br/>
On your side of the fence." | <br/>
Okay. | <br/>
Come on in. | Let me wash those clothes. | <br/>
When I used to represent Hooch | from Turner &amp; Hooch, | <br/>
I got a similar call | about a late-night trespasser. | <br/>
Turned out it was Benji's trainer. | <br/>
Uh, he was jealous that Hooch | was now the hottest dog in the business. | <br/>
-You're making that up. | -No, no, no, I think that's true. | <br/>
You're insane, Sandy. | Take off those pants. | <br/>
What? What, right here? | <br/>
I won't look. | <br/>
Well, you'll be missing out, then. | <br/>
Oh, really? | <br/>
No. Maybe you should turn around. | <br/>
[chuckles] Turning around. | <br/>
I'm glad you took this place, by the way. | <br/>

that David Crosby died | three times in this house. | <br/>

co-headlining with AJ Jamal. | I wanna make sure that went well. | <br/>
So, pants are coming down. | <br/>
Here you go. | <br/>
[sighs] | <br/>
All right. Come on. | Let's get these washed. | <br/>
Sure. Hey, thanks for doing that. | <br/>
You called Bling, too? | <br/>
Oh, I was here anyway, Sandy. | <br/>
With my pants on. | <br/>
The important thing | is that Courtney feels safe. | <br/>
-That's all I'm worried about. | -[Courtney] Hmm. | <br/>
An unlisted phone number. | <br/>
That's the way to go | for an artist of your stature. | <br/>
I can get that done for you | tomorrow morning. | <br/>
Oh, no, it's all... It's all good, Sandy. | I handled it already. | <br/>
Oh, you did? Good. Good. Good for you. | <br/>
Sandy, can you pass me the gravy? | <br/>
Can I pass you the gravy? | Absolutely. I can pass you the gravy. | <br/>
-Here. You want me to put it on for you? | -I got it. | <br/>
-You got it? | -Yeah. | <br/>
I was thinking we should get back | in the studio, Courtney. | <br/>
Maybe noodle around with some new tunes. | <br/>
[chuckles] With all due respect, Sandy, | I understand that, | <br/>
but, uh, her existing record's | gonna be on the charts for months. | <br/>
You don't want her competing | against herself now, do you? | <br/>
Who else do you want her competing with? | I mean it's a win-win. To me. | <br/>
I know what you mean, Sandy. | <br/>
I have lots of ideas, | but I can't tomorrow. | <br/>
We've got publicist meetings. | <br/>
-Publicists? What... what publicists? | -Oh, yeah, just the top ones. | <br/>
You know what? | I'll send you the list, actually. | <br/>
You know what? | Better yet, I'll e-mail you the list. | <br/>
-What is that? | -Oh, you're not familiar with e-mail? | <br/>
E-mail? Of course I heard of that. | Which one are you talking about? | <br/>
You got your computer, right? | And you plug that into your phone line... | <br/>
...and you could send a document to | another computer clear across the country | <br/>
in a matter of minutes. | <br/>
Who licks the envelope? R2-D2? | I'm lost right now. | <br/>
Now I think we're making | a wrong move here. | <br/>
I have a publicity campaign designed | strictly for this woman right here. | <br/>
You have a publicity campaign? Well, | I mean, we're... The family's all here. | <br/>
We would love to hear about it. | What is it? | <br/>
Well, I usually like my clients | to start slow. | <br/>
Keep it simple. Don't overexpose. | <br/>
-Really, Sandy? [laughs] | -Yes. | <br/>
Just gonna spit your chicken on my face? | That's for you. | <br/>
Okay. Maybe we'll hold off | on the publicist thing. | <br/>
Thank you. | <br/>
But then we'll bring in one soon. | <br/>
-Okay, boys? | -We'll talk about that. | <br/>
Absolutely. I think that's smart. | <br/>
All right. I'm gonna go check | on these jeans. | <br/>
-Okay? | -Yes, my queen. | <br/>
Your queen? | <br/>
[door closes] | <br/>
Sandy, you are the reason | she needs a publicist. | <br/>
I'm the reason? | <br/>
You know how many calls I got after | Quincy Jones threw you out of his party? | <br/>
-Oh... She dared me to do it. | -What are you, 14, Sandy? | <br/>
No, I'm not 14. I'm not 14 at all. | <br/>
Your job is to protect her. | <br/>
I protect her 24/7! | <br/>
And how is that? | By screwing up her shot on Arsenio? | <br/>
We got the show, didn't we? | <br/>
Because I fixed it! | <br/>
You fixed it. You did everything. | You invented music. | <br/>
What did you do, Sandy? | <br/>
Did you file the paperwork for the Grammy | nomination before the deadline? | <br/>
Did you squash the story in the Enquirer | <br/>
about her corrections officer father | falling asleep during a prison riot? | <br/>
Did you send envelopes of cash | to the radio stations | <br/>
so they could play her record? | <br/>
No, you didn't do that. | <br/>
You know how I know | you didn't do it, Sandy? | <br/>
Because I did it. I did all those things. | <br/>
And what did you do? Hmm? | <br/>
You made sure Gary, | the daredevil trapeze artist, | <br/>
was her opening act | at the Universal Amphitheatre. | <br/>
Gary is family. | <br/>
This dude shattered his pelvis | on an amplifier! | <br/>
I was there. I saw. | <br/>
There was blood | all over the first three rows! | <br/>
-People were vomiting! | -Yeah, all right. | <br/>
That doesn't really segue well | <br/>
into soulful singer-songwriter now, | does it, Sandy? | <br/>
She got 'em back. | She's too good to lose a crowd. | <br/>
She's too good for you. | <br/>
Sandy, she could have | any manager she wants. | <br/>
She wants me! | <br/>
And that is what's holding her back. | <br/>
Look, Sandy, you did your job. | <br/>
[imitating Sandy] | You brought her up to the big leagues. | <br/>
I'm telling you. Come on! | <br/>
But now you're just... | You're out of your depth. | <br/>
Don't let your ego get in the way. | <br/>
Can you look me in the eye and tell me | you're doing what's best for her? | <br/>
-[Courtney] Okay. | -Ah! | <br/>
Pants-Off Dance-Off | is officially canceled. | <br/>
-Put these bad boys on. | -Okay. | <br/>
You got the stain out? | Very nice. Look at you. Look at you. | <br/>
Well, I'm beat to shit. | I'm gonna call it. | <br/>
You're gonna call it? | All right. I'll walk you out, then. | <br/>
Thank you for everything. | Appreciate it all. | <br/>
Oh. Oh, yeah. Good night. | <br/>
Thanks for scaring the stalker raccoon. | <br/>
You don't have to thank me, Courtney. | That's my pleasure. | <br/>
Look, Sandy... | <br/>
This rock star thing is new to me. | <br/>
I'm doing the best I can | to make everybody happy, you know. | <br/>
You make the world happy, Courtney. | That's all you need to worry about. | <br/>
Thank you, Sandy. | <br/>
That's why it's difficult | for me to tell you this. | <br/>
But where you are right now | in your career, | <br/>
and what it requires of my time, it's... | <br/>
I'm being kind of forced here | to make sacrifices that, | <br/>
with good conscience, | I don't really wanna make. | <br/>
Like what? | <br/>
Like my stable of talent. | <br/>
I can't give them what I believe | each and every one of them deserves | <br/>
if I'm worried about all the complexities | of your day-to-day. | <br/>
It's a lot, kid. I'm sorry. | <br/>
So what? You don't want | to work together anymore? | <br/>
Well, it's just the current situation | isn't fair to you, either. | <br/>
I can't commit to you 100% | if I got other things on my mind, | <br/>
which unfortunately I do. | The stable. | <br/>
Sandy, let's not do this right now. | <br/>
Let's take a minute and think it over. | <br/>
I don't need a minute. | <br/>
I promised your dad | I'd always do what's best for you. | <br/>
This is best. | <br/>
So that's it? | <br/>
You ever need me, just beep. | <br/>
Sandy. | <br/>
Beep. | <br/>
You're gonna be all right, Courtney. | <br/>
You're gonna be a legend. | <br/>
Brightest star out there. | <br/>
[sobbing] | <br/>
Legend has it he stayed in that car | and cried for... six hours? | <br/>
[wailing] | <br/>
Someone called child services 'cause | they thought a little girl was in trouble. | <br/>
-Yeah. | -In a car. | <br/>
[sobbing loudly] | <br/>
I mean, not that anybody has a good cry, | <br/>
but his cry sounded | like some kind of, like, | <br/>
lonesome moose. | [imitates moose calling] | <br/>
[continues sobbing] | <br/>
Whatever the amount of time was | that he cried, | <br/>
he broke his own rules. | He just got too close. | <br/>
It was Alfred all over again. | <br/>
That was a tough time... | <br/>
'cause Sandy not only lost | his most talented client ever, | <br/>
but he also lost this person | he had feelings for. | <br/>
[woman] It must've been | especially painful for Sandy, | <br/>
because Courtney Clarke was everywhere. | <br/>
Whoo! | <br/>

[sighs] | <br/>
What have we got here? | <br/>
[gasps] Sandy! | <br/>
I was scared you wouldn't come. | <br/>
Hey. Where's Peter? Is he doing PT? | <br/>
[chuckles] Sandy, why don't you | take off your shoes? | <br/>
Take off my... Oh, for your rug? | <br/>
You know, my shoes are actually cleaner | <br/>
-than my socks, but... | -[laughs] | <br/>
[Cindy] And here we are. | <br/>
[both laugh] | <br/>
-Hey, hey. | -And here's your throne. | <br/>
Why don't you sit down, Sandy? [chuckles] | <br/>
-Hey. | -What would you like to drink? | <br/>
You know, I got a bit of a sour stomach. | <br/>
If you got Dr. Brown's black cherry diet, | that would be perfect. | <br/>
Or a big glass of whiskey. | Either way is... | <br/>
[rock music playing] | <br/>
Oh, look. | <br/>
[stammers] Ah. | <br/>
[mutters appreciatively] | <br/>
Did you ever see | that naughty little movie, 9½ Weeks? | <br/>
No, I didn't. | <br/>
I saw Problem Child, though. | That kid was hysterical. | <br/>
Well, not as funny as that. | Look at you. [laughs] | <br/>
-Peter's been sick for a long time. | -Yeah. | <br/>
And a woman yearns for a man's touch. | <br/>
Hey, no, that's natural. | <br/>
Are you a man, Sandy? | <br/>
I don't know. I... | <br/>
I was bar mitzvahed, | but that was a long time ago. | <br/>
[laughs] | <br/>
-You know what I love about you? | -Yeah? | <br/>
-Your voice. | -[laughs] | <br/>
Come on. I've got a surprise. | <br/>
-Come along. | -Hey, what's this? | <br/>
-[stammers] Just sit here. Now, sit. | -Oh! Oh, yeah. | <br/>
Aye, aye, aye! Yeah! | <br/>
Touch me, Sandy. Touch me. | <br/>
Well, I... I was just walking | on the carpet in my socks. | <br/>
-I don't wanna zap you. | -Oh. You can zap me. Just zap me. | <br/>
[both laughing] | <br/>
Cindy! | <br/>
-[EKG machine beeping] | -[wheezing] | <br/>
[Peter whimpers] | <br/>
Don't worry about Peter. | He only wants my happiness. | <br/>
Yeah. | <br/>
[groaning] | <br/>
[stammers] I can't do it. I can't. | <br/>
-I'd feel better if we-- | -Don't, Sandy, please. | <br/>
-Don't leave. Stay here. | -Oh... | <br/>
We... we could put a blanket | over his head. | <br/>
-That's... that's actually a thought. | -[Peter groans] | <br/>
No. He says no. He said... I'm sorry. | <br/>
[stammers] I consider Peter a friend, | <br/>
whether he's alive or dead | or in a vegetative state. | <br/>
Thanks for the offer, okay? | <br/>
-[static crackles] | -[yells] | <br/>
I got the shock! I knew I... The socks. | <br/>
[sighs] | <br/>
[Peter groans] | <br/>
Pervert. | <br/>
[reporters clamoring] | <br/>
-[man 1] Cindy! | -[man 2] Cindy! | <br/>
[man 3] Madonna! | <br/>
[man 4] Melissa! | <br/>
-Wrapping up the CDs. | -[Sandy laughs] | <br/>
-Doing too good a job. I feel that... | -[audience laughs] | <br/>
[Sandy laughs] | <br/>
Just... a little bit overzealous | with the wrapping is my feeling. | <br/>
-What is the security on this thing? | -[laughing] | <br/>
It's a $12 item. | <br/>
They got it wrapped up | like the Hope Diamond. | <br/>
It's impossible | that they have cellophane... | <br/>
What are you doing? You look gloomy. | Reiser's killing out there. Come on. | <br/>
You're like a monkey with a coconut. | You're just looking at it... | <br/>
He's killing the jokes that I wrote. | It should be me up there killing it. | <br/>
Next year, it will be. | CBS sees your jokes work now. | <br/>
Next year, you'll be telling those jokes, | 'cause you wrote 'em. | <br/>
[laughing] | <br/>
You want me to do the jokes | he's telling right now | <br/>
on next year's Grammys? | <br/>
But you do 'em in your voice. | <br/>
But the punch lines are the same. | People have heard them already. | <br/>
You do new punch lines. | <br/>
So then they're new... | They're new jokes. | <br/>
No, but you're doing 'em in your voice. | <br/>
I wanna strangle you. | <br/>
-Don't say "your voice" again. | -What are you... | <br/>
I'm gonna kill you | if you say "in my voice." | <br/>
-Would you stop? I can't ever-- | -Sandy? | <br/>
Courtney. | <br/>
Look at you! | <br/>
-Hey! Hey. | -Hey! Oh. | <br/>
You, uh, remember my, uh, | client Paul Reiser? | <br/>
-Kevin Connors. | -Kevin! | <br/>
They should have had you host this show. | <br/>
Paul Reiser is usually funny, | but his jokes tonight are just corny. | <br/>
-You still doing Atkins? I see. | -Atkins. | <br/>
-You look great! | -Thank you. Well, my God. | <br/>
-I look good? Look at you. | -You look so good! | <br/>
I have been following you. | You are doing so well. | <br/>
The Grammy tonight. Did I tell you | when that was gonna happen, huh? | <br/>
You deserve it all. You really do. | <br/>
You deserve it, too. | I wouldn't be here without you. | <br/>
Are you kidding me? | You cannot stop a shooting star. | <br/>
-Aw. | -Our scientists have proven this. | <br/>
You are unbelievable, Sandy. | <br/>
How's Bling? Where is he? | <br/>
Yeah, he's my label guy. | He's not my guy-guy anymore. | <br/>
-Well, I'm so sorry. That's-- | -Don't be. | <br/>
Things happen for a reason. | <br/>
I scored us each a goodie bag, my sweet. | <br/>
-Hi, cuteness. | -Can I keep your PlayStation? | <br/>
Yes. | <br/>
Guys, this is my new boyfriend, Ra... | Say it for me, babe. | <br/>
Ramiro Alejandro. | <br/>
Sandy Wexler. | Nice to meet you, Ramir... [stammers] | <br/>
-Ramiro Alejandro. | -I know. | <br/>
Oh, is this the old Make-A-Wish guy | you were telling me about? | <br/>
No. No, we used to work together. | <br/>
Hey, you wanna come to Clive Davis' | after-party? You could ride with us. | <br/>
I, uh, would love to. | <br/>
-I, uh, have to go somewhere. | -[Courtney] Aw. | <br/>
A client of mine... Amy Baskin. | You... you remember Amy. | <br/>
Yeah! | <br/>
Yes, well, she got the lead in | Sound of Music at the Pasadena Playhouse. | <br/>
-She'll be Partygoer Number One. | -[laughs] Yeah, that's the lead. | <br/>
It is. She's... she's the lead partygoer. | <br/>
Let's get together real soon, Sandy. | Promise me. | <br/>
-I promise. You promise me this. | -Of course. What? | <br/>
-After Clive's party... | -Mmm-hmm. | <br/>
-...you put on the ugly duckling hat... | -Oh, gosh. | <br/>
...and you remind yourself | where you came from. | <br/>
Not on this hair. | <br/>
-Like we... Nope, not on your hair. | -[man] Courtney... | <br/>
-You promise? | -...we have to go. | <br/>
-I promise. Okay. | -I gotta see you. Okay. | <br/>
[Courtney] Good to see you, babe. | <br/>
Nice meeting you, Sammy! | Hope they find a cure for you, buddy. | <br/>
Buddy, move. Move! | <br/>
-Get out the way! | -Which way are you moving? | <br/>
-Okay, go! | -Sandy, move! Sandy! | <br/>
That was another tough goodbye for Sandy. | <br/>
He... he didn't even know if he | would ever see or talk to Courtney again. | <br/>
Of course he kept himself busy. | <br/>
He actually signed someone | <br/>
who was involved in the biggest form | of entertainment in the '90s. | <br/>
Wrestling. Professional wrestling. | <br/>
-[yelling] | -[bell dings] | <br/>
Yeah! [grunting] | <br/>
[yelling] | <br/>
Yeah! | <br/>
Go to sleep, baby! | It's night-night time! [grunts] | <br/>
[yelling] | <br/>
-[man] You're the man, Bedtime. | -Isn't he? | <br/>
Oh, I know you're gonna | take the title on Sunday. | <br/>
-I'm gonna make 'em go night-night. | -[laughs] | <br/>
-Thank you. | -I'm gonna lose. | <br/>
You don't know that. Hang on, please. | <br/>
Yeah, I do know that. I got the script. | <br/>
Tsunami sits on my face until I tap out. | I'm never gonna be the champ. | <br/>
Okay, look. | <br/>
The good thing is, you're gonna have | a grown man sit on your face | <br/>
and the entire world is gonna be watching. | That's a positive. | <br/>
-That's not a positive. | -It's a positive because it's... | <br/>
-The fame factor. | -What? | <br/>
Hey, Bedtime. Will you rock me like a baby | while my brother Dicky gets a picture? | <br/>
-What are you, six? | -Yeah, of course he will. | <br/>
-Of course he will do it. | -Do you see the size of this guy? | <br/>
Just get on it. | <br/>
Oh. Hang on, guys. | My cellular device is ringing. | <br/>
And I hit this, and I pull this. | <br/>
Wexler Artists. | <br/>
Mr. Wexler, it is Chippy from Dan Tana's. | <br/>
Chippy! Hey! How's it going? | How was your vacation to Cincinnati? | <br/>
It was, uh, not a vacation. | My mother died. | <br/>
I went to Cincinnati for the funeral. | <br/>
Oh, yeah. That's right. How's your mother? | <br/>
[stammering] | <br/>
What are you calling for? | <br/>
We have a delicate situation with a client | of yours who has had too much to drink. | <br/>
And unfortunately, | there are very many paparazzi out front. | <br/>
[clamoring] | <br/>
Oh, boy. Was it Gary or Kevin? | <br/>
-[bones crack] | -[man groans] | <br/>
[man] Yeah, I chased him | for six or seven blocks. | <br/>
Just come on. Get a life, guys. Jeez. | <br/>
[indistinct chatter] | <br/>
-Bring me to the package. | -This way. | <br/>
Courtney? | <br/>
What the... What's going on, kiddo? | <br/>
Sandy! They found you! | <br/>
Yeah, they found me. | <br/>
You just stay put, okay? | You stay right there. | <br/>
[exclaims] | <br/>
Aw, Sandy to the rescue. | <br/>
No one can find out about this. | You understand me, Chippy? Not even you. | <br/>
[scoffs] Okay, Sandy. | <br/>
-[grunts] Okay. | -Sandy! | <br/>
What? She'll suffocate? | Is that what you're saying? | <br/>
[all chanting] | Courtney! Courtney! Courtney! | <br/>
[Sandy] Go jump in a lake, fellas! | <br/>
[dogs barking] | <br/>
Ah! No, no, no, no! Oh, come on! | Oh, please, please, please. | <br/>
Keep your voices down. Let her sleep. | <br/>
That's right. Just sleep. Sleep, sleep. | <br/>
Let me get this up for you. | <br/>
And you... you're breathing. | <br/>
Are you breathing? | <br/>
Yeah, there it is. Okay. | <br/>
You'll be all right. | <br/>
[Sandy] I'm telling you, he's the best | ventriloquist in the business. He... | <br/>
[woman] You don't see him talking? | <br/>
No, you see his lips move slightly, | but that's not the important thing. | <br/>
The important thing | is what the guy is saying. | <br/>
No one looks at the lips | if they're laughing, then... | <br/>
No, kids love him. | <br/>
[stammers] That's why I'm bringing it up | to you. The kids will love this guy. | <br/>
He's got curly hair, | and... and he's got the mustache. | <br/>
I'm sorry. | <br/>
-Linda, I'm... I'm just asking if you... | -Do you want some breakfast? | <br/>
-Sandy... | -If you could just | <br/>
put a good word in for me. That's it. | <br/>
Maybe put his headshot on his desk. | <br/>
-I really wish I could, Sandy. | -Hey, just meat, right? | <br/>
Oh, yeah. Hold on. Just meat. | <br/>
Just meet with him. | <br/>
That's all I'm asking you to do. | Just meet with him. | <br/>
All right, Sandy. | <br/>
Thank you, Linda! Thank you! | <br/>
Happy birthday on Wednesday. | <br/>
-How did you know that? | -Yeah, 'cause I know. | <br/>
'Cause I know. I know everything. | <br/>
How good is this? Phenomenal. | <br/>
No one knows | how to cook health food like... | <br/>
You're fantastic. You can do it all. | <br/>
I owe you for last night. | I'm embarrassed. | <br/>
Hey, everybody gets zonked | once in a while. | <br/>
The question is, why are we doing it? | <br/>
I don't know. I... | <br/>
I just broke up with Billy. | <br/>
Billy? Who's Billy? | What happened to the Marc Anthony fella? | <br/>
Marc Anthony? Come on, Sandy. | <br/>
Pick up a People magazine | every once in a while. | <br/>
That was three boyfriends ago. | <br/>
Oh, hey, I gotta start writing | some of these names down. | <br/>
I'm getting lost. | I'm joking around with you. | <br/>
What you're doing's perfectly natural. | <br/>
Anyone in your position | would be doing the same. | <br/>
Look, Liza did it. | <br/>
Elizabeth Taylor did it. | Sherwood Schwartz did it. | <br/>
[sighs] Just my life. | <br/>
It feels out of control. | <br/>
I can't connect with anybody. | I don't... I just don't feel safe. | <br/>
I can't even go ten feet | <br/>
without the paparazzi following me, | taking pictures of me, spying on me. | <br/>
I don't even want to | leave my house anymore. | <br/>
What? You gotta leave your house. | <br/>
Even Michael Jackson | leaves his house once in a while. | <br/>
How? | <br/>
He just don't look like Michael Jackson. | <br/>
Excuse me, sir. | You know what time it is? | <br/>
[laughing] | <br/>
Can you do me a favor? | <br/>
Courtney Clarke was just in there. | Uh, could you find out where she went? | <br/>
This is... | Somebody just got their life back! | <br/>
-[laughs] | -Why do you own this stuff? | <br/>
Why? Those are my workout clothes. | <br/>
You work out? [laughs] | <br/>
Suzanne Somers personally gave me | one of the very first ThighMasters. | <br/>
I use it as much as I can. | <br/>
This conversation is over. | <br/>
What? It's for firm thighs and buttocks. | <br/>
-Sandy, please stop talking. | -All right. | <br/>
What we gonna do today? | <br/>
What we gonna do today? | Anything you want, kiddo. | <br/>
-Okay, lead the way, ThighMaster. | -Hey! Now, wait a minute. | <br/>
-By the way, the dogs are good for cardio. | -Oh. | <br/>
What does that mean? | <br/>
-You'll see. | -[dogs barking] | <br/>
-[Sandy] Go! Run! Run! Run! | -Okay! Okay! | <br/>
[Sandy] Well, here comes the test. | <br/>
Look at that. Look at that. Huh? | <br/>
-[laughs] | -Wow. | <br/>
Why am I golfing? | <br/>
Golfing is very relaxing. | <br/>
You don't have to think | about nothing but smacking that ball. | <br/>
Have you ever played before? | <br/>
-No. | -No? It's quite easy. | <br/>
I'll take out the big stick | 'cause it's fun to hit 'em far. | <br/>
It's always good to warm up a little bit. | Ow! Okay. | <br/>
I got actually a little problem | in the back. | <br/>
-You okay? | -Yeah. Just give me one sec. | <br/>
God damn it. | <br/>
-Should I call for help? | -No, I'll be all right. | <br/>
Just give me one sec. | I just gotta stretch. | <br/>
All right. Just give me one more sec. | I do need help. | <br/>
You need to go to the bathroom? | <br/>
No, I'm just... I'm getting it lined up. | <br/>
Let's just say goodbye | to all our troubles, okay? | <br/>
Okay. | <br/>
If you got any problems, | put 'em into the ball and send them away. | <br/>
Is it supposed to curve | off to the right like that? | <br/>
Yeah, I was playing a dogleg right. | <br/>
-A dogleg? | -Right. | <br/>
You gotta bend it around the trees, | and that's what I was going for. | <br/>
-Can I try it? | -You wanna try? Okay. | <br/>
I was gonna show you | a little more, but okay. | <br/>
-Okay. | -So let me... | <br/>
You know, maybe you should | tee it up for yourself. | <br/>
Tee it up. Here. | <br/>
-You tee it up, and you say goodbye. | -Right here. | <br/>
Okay. | <br/>
And just have a good time | and don't worry about where it goes. | <br/>
-Let's see. | -Okay. | <br/>
Am I being hustled right now? | What was that? | <br/>
I swear I didn't play every day growing up | with my Uncle Davey who's a golf pro. | <br/>
-Oh, well... | -[Courtney laughs] | <br/>
Does this guy need a manager because... | <br/>
-Come over here. | -What are we doing? | <br/>
We gotta work on that slice leg. | <br/>
-Oh, my God. | -Here you go. Here you go. | <br/>
-This is your day. I don't want to... | -No. No, no, no. You got it? | <br/>
-You're okay with it? [laughs] | -Oh, it's my day now. Come on. | <br/>
-In the hips. | -In the hips. | <br/>
Here we go. | <br/>
Oh! All right! Hold on now. [laughs] | <br/>
Huh? I beg your pardon? | <br/>
[Sandy] Tell me. Tell me. | <br/>
[Courtney] A company called Pixar... | <br/>
-[Sandy] Pixar? | -...wants me to do a voice | <br/>
in some animated movie | about a bunch of toys. | <br/>
[Sandy] Cartoons are dead. | <br/>
-Tell 'em pass. | -[Courtney chuckles] | <br/>
-Okay. Sandy knows best. | -I mean, come on. I do know best. | <br/>
The lady at Chili's said they'll keep it | open till 10:30 for us, so that's good. | <br/>
How you feeling anyway? | <br/>
As good as anybody can feel | <br/>
knowing they're about to get | their face sat on by that guy. | <br/>
Damn, that's a big ass! | <br/>
-That's right-- | -Get off me! | <br/>
Listen. Will you just trust me? | This is a good night for you. | <br/>
Trust you? It's humiliating. | <br/>
My kids are out there, man! | My wife might not ever kiss me again! | <br/>
Randy Savage had to get whooped 24 times | <br/>
before he finally pinned Ted DiBiase | to win the belt, man! | <br/>
How does your platinum-selling ass | know about wrestling history? | <br/>
I'm from Alaska. | It was either watch wrestling or fish. | <br/>
Is that adorable? | <br/>
Will you just take it all in | and promise me you'll have fun? | <br/>
This is a big night for you. | Look at me. | <br/>
Man, how does your goofy ass | have me feeling good right now? | <br/>
That's impossible! | <br/>
Because you know I love ya | and I'm your family. | <br/>
All right, good luck. | <br/>
Get out there! | <br/>
[crowd cheering] | <br/>
Yeah! Come on! | <br/>
-[referee] Fight! | -[bell ringing] | <br/>
[Bobby yelling] | <br/>
Okay. | <br/>
[Tsunami exclaiming] | <br/>
[crowd groans] | <br/>
[exclaims] | <br/>
No! | <br/>
[exclaiming] | <br/>
[yelling] | <br/>
Break, break, break, break! | <br/>
Hey, what are you doing? | Stick to the script. | <br/>
I'm sorry, Tsunami. | You're gonna have to earn this one. | <br/>
What? Hey... | <br/>
[crowd clamoring] | <br/>
This is bullshit. | I'm supposed to win. | <br/>
This happening? | Huh, this is happening? | <br/>
Well, bring it on! | <br/>
[yells] | <br/>
Okay, get back there, champ! | <br/>
-[yells] | -[groans] | <br/>
There it is. Now it's getting real. | <br/>
[both grunting] | <br/>
Thank you very much! | <br/>
What is this? | <br/>
No, you're not! What's going on here? | <br/>
Say it! | <br/>
It's time to go night-night! | <br/>
[crowd cheering] | <br/>
[bell dings] | <br/>
[crowd cheering] | <br/>
[yells] | <br/>
-I got the belt! I'm the champ! [laughs] | -[man] You the man! You the man! | <br/>
-Sandy! How? | -What do you... Huh? | <br/>
The referee is a client, and | Wexler Artists look out for each other. | <br/>
Oh, man! | Those guys are gonna fire his ass! | <br/>
Of course they are, | <br/>
but I already got him a job as a referee | for the Harlem Globetrotters. | <br/>
-I know. I understand. | -You're never going to work again! | <br/>
What do you say, champ? Proud of ya. | <br/>
Oh! I'm so happy, Sandy! | <br/>
I love you. This is your moment. | This is all you. | <br/>
I'm just so happy for you | and your wife and your kids. | <br/>
Okay? That's all I want. | <br/>
-I love you! I love you! | -You deserve everything! | <br/>
-Courtney, get in here! | -You deserve everything! | <br/>
Uh, we do have to go to Chili's, though. | <br/>
I told the lady we'd be there | by 10:30, so let's get going. | <br/>
-Why are you talking about Chili's now? | -I just don't wanna... | <br/>
I don't want her to screw us | for the next time, you know. Let's go. | <br/>
[Sandy] Eat up those baby backs, guys. | <br/>
How do you take care of everybody | and never worry about yourself? | <br/>
How do you become Sandy? | <br/>
Oh, well, listen. | <br/>
How do you get to Carnegie Hall? | Practice, practice, practice. | <br/>
-Hmm. [chuckles] | -Huh? | <br/>
I wish I could stay here. | <br/>
This is the best day I've had in years. | <br/>
Listen, you can stay as long as you want. | <br/>
I'm supposed to go to New York tomorrow | <br/>
and shoot this VH1 thing | with Lenny Kravitz. | <br/>
Yeah? | <br/>
That's a good thing. | <br/>
Is it? | <br/>
Then why don't I wanna go? | <br/>
Tell me I don't have to go, Sandy. | <br/>
No, no, no. | <br/>
Why won't you? | <br/>
'Cause that's not my job anymore. | <br/>
Okay. | <br/>
What do you want me to do? | <br/>
What I want you to do | is concentrate on your career. | <br/>
Music comes first. | <br/>
Go to New York. | <br/>
-You know what? [scoffs] | -What? | <br/>
You're a jerk. | <br/>
[Firuz] Oh, God, yes! | <br/>
What was that? | <br/>
-Firuz! | -Oh, all right, then. | <br/>
I'll go take a walk or something. | <br/>
Have the best night of your life, Sandy. | <br/>
I'm trying. | <br/>
Ultimately, I have to move. | <br/>
[Courtney] | The day was perfect, the night was better. | <br/>
Thank you. I'm off to New York. | <br/>
Sandy knows best. | <br/>
Love, Court. | <br/>
-Pick that up! | -Shut up, Firuz! | <br/>
Just shut up. | <br/>
Success can be really lonely. | <br/>
That's why you kinda long | for someone to share it with. | <br/>
So a week later, | her and Lenny Kravitz moved in together. | <br/>
And then two weeks later after that, | moved out. | <br/>
And she moved on to Johnny Depp. | <br/>
-Chris Cornell. | -George Clooney. | <br/>
-Ziggy Marley. | -Pauly Shore. | <br/>
I went out with her? | <br/>
Man, Sandy was messed up. | <br/>
[man] Sir, are you committing suicide? | <br/>
'Cause I don't think | I'm allowed to film that! | <br/>
No, I'm not! | <br/>
I'm fine, thank you very much! | <br/>
She can date whoever she wants to date! | That's her thing! | <br/>
-He's talking to me. | -He's talking to you? | <br/>
Sandy, that pool looks far away. | How long until my skin starts burning? | <br/>
I think the safety advisor | said four seconds you get | <br/>
before you must be wet. | <br/>
You think he said that | or he said that? Four? | <br/>
I got to admit, I haven't been sleeping. | I'm just so tired. | <br/>
I don't care. I'm about to be lit on fire! | <br/>
He said it! He said what he said. | <br/>
Okay, here we go. Right calf first. | <br/>
Okay. Okay. | <br/>
-Okay! [yelling] | -Okay, go, go, go! | <br/>
Whoo! Yeah! | <br/>
-[bat chirping] | -What? Oh! | <br/>
[groans] No! | <br/>
[screams and groans] | <br/>
No! [groans] | <br/>
Okay. So birds sleep at night, | but the bats wake up. | <br/>
-Okay. | -[Gary groaning loudly] | <br/>
Now we know. Now we know. | No, this is a good thing. | <br/>
I'm telling you, Bud, | he can follow anybody. | <br/>
He can follow... He followed Minnie | at The Ice House recently. | <br/>
I know you don't like The Ice House. | I don't know why I said that. I'm sorry. | <br/>
All right, I'm gonna go watch Kevin. | <br/>
-Hey, Sandy. | -Kirby. | <br/>
You got a minute? | <br/>
Yeah, I'm going to watch | my client on stage. | <br/>
Actually, Kevin and I think | it's time for a change. | <br/>
He's dumping me through you? | <br/>
You gotta admit, | you've been a bit clingy. I'm telling ya. | <br/>
You're telling me? I'm telling you. | <br/>
So we agree. | <br/>
Bud, Alex, how are you guys? | Good to see you. | <br/>
It's all happening here tonight, isn't it? | <br/>
[mouths] | <br/>
♪ You give me butterfly, butterflies ♪ | <br/>
♪ Down in my soul ♪ | <br/>
♪ Butterflies, butterfly ♪ | <br/>
Why the hell do you | have me singing that song? | <br/>
-They hated it! | -No. | <br/>
This is an awful idea, Sandy! | <br/>
No, I... I'm telling you, | you did better than you think! | <br/>
-You are out of your mind! | -No! No! | <br/>
-I'm sorry. | -No, don't. | <br/>
-It's time you go night-night. | -No night-night! No! | <br/>
-You're fired. | -Oh, God! Come on! | <br/>
No! You can't do that to me! Aah! | <br/>
We're done, Sandy. We're done! | <br/>
Don't say that. | <br/>
[screaming] | <br/>
[narrator on TV] | Your life is an adventure. | <br/>
You don't want to miss a single moment. | <br/>
-[Sandy] This girl's the new Grace Kelly. | -Now, you don't have to. | <br/>
Vag-Eze, America's number one | vaginal discharge ointment. | <br/>
Side effects include dryness, | burning, itching, fallopian tube-- | <br/>
-What's vaginal discharge? | -Can I have some? | <br/>
You said it was | a coffee commercial, Sandy! | <br/>
What the hell is going on here? | <br/>
Please, God, I need a miracle. | <br/>
[thunder crashing] | <br/>
[old-time music playing] | <br/>
[Mr. Buttons] "Remember, kids, | if you laugh when you are blue, | <br/>
the sun... [sniffles] | <br/>
...will always shine on you. | <br/>
[voice breaking] Honk, honk. | <br/>
Mr. Buttons." | <br/>
[sniffling] | <br/>
[exhales heavily] | <br/>
[thunder rumbles] | <br/>
[clattering] | <br/>
Teddy! | <br/>
Wonderful news. Mr. Buttons is dead! | <br/>
You killed him? | <br/>
[laughs] No! He hung himself! | <br/>
-Really? | -His time slot's open, guys. | <br/>
I got you the audition. | <br/>
It doesn't feel right. | I mean, I feel bad for the guy. | <br/>
Screw Mr. Buttons! It's our turn! | <br/>
-He couldn't take the pressure. | -He took the coward's way out. | <br/>
I gotta tell you, it's the first time | I... I agree with the puppets. | <br/>
[children laughing] | <br/>
Friend Boom Boom is gonna | sing a song for us today, kids. | <br/>
Would you like that? | Would you like to hear it? | <br/>
[children cheering] | <br/>
I hate singing. | <br/>
What are you talking about? | You sing all the time. | <br/>
You sing in the car, | you sing in the shower... | <br/>
You spy on me in the shower? | <br/>
-That is not what I meant. | -I can sing, Ted. | <br/>
-Would you like to hear that, kids? | -[children] Yeah! | <br/>
[clearing throat] | <br/>
-[continues clearing throat] | -[children laughing] | <br/>
You have something | in your throat, Heather? | <br/>
Yeah, your hand, dummy! | <br/>
I can't believe it. | These kids are eating your boy up! | <br/>
I mean, he could be the next Buttons. | <br/>
-Didn't I tell you? Didn't I say? | -Yeah, great. | <br/>
Hey! There's a caterpillar on your face. | <br/>
What's with you? | What, are you okay? | <br/>
-No, no, I, uh... | -Something wrong? There's something wrong? | <br/>
Maybe a little dizzy. | I had too many bacon bits this morning. | <br/>
Bacon Bits? What is that? | That's a dog food, no? | <br/>
No. Didn't say that on the box. | <br/>
Yeah, all right, whatever. Tell you what, | you come to my office in an hour. | <br/>
We'll hammer out a deal. | <br/>
I'll get your boy on the air ASAP. | Okay, bud? | <br/>
All righty. That makes me very happy. | <br/>
[children laughing] | <br/>
-[Sandy] They absolutely loved you. | -[Ted laughing] | <br/>
-You're getting the job, Teddy. | -I did good. I did good. | <br/>
My only fear is they're gonna try | to lowball you on the deal, all right? | <br/>
The key to this meeting is tough talk. | <br/>
These TV jerks only respond | to bullying and aggression. | <br/>
Well, I'll let you handle all that, okay? | [chuckles] | <br/>
I'm no doctor, | but Sandy look like crap on a stick. | <br/>
No, I'm fine. | <br/>
-Sandy! | -[Sandy] No. | <br/>
[Heather] I think | he's having a heart attack. | <br/>
We... we gotta get you to a hospital. | Boom Boom, call an ambulance! | <br/>
No, Boom Boom. | First meeting, close deal, then hop-ital. | <br/>
Forget the meeting. | You can barely speak. | <br/>
But... you can. | <br/>
[Marty] So what we saw in there | told us everything we need to know. | <br/>
We love Ted. The kids love Ted. | <br/>
-That is... That's spectacular. | -[clapping] | <br/>
Thank you. | Thank you so much. | <br/>
But the fact is | he's never been on television. | <br/>
So here's the deal. | <br/>
Six episodes, 15 grand a pop, | and then we see what we do from there. | <br/>
[muttering indistinctly] | <br/>
[Ted clears throat] | <br/>
[imitating Sandy] | Are you kidding me, Marty? | <br/>
-What? | -You think I'm a complete a-hole? | <br/>
No, no, no. | <br/>
Then why are you treating me like one? | <br/>
I think it's a reasonable | starting place, Sandy. | <br/>
[grunts] | <br/>
Reasonable, Fishbein? It's dog crap. | <br/>
If we take this deal, | <br/>
my guy's gonna end up at the end of a rope | just like your last clown. | <br/>
-Whoa, man! | -All right. Sandy, Sandy. Take it easy. | <br/>
Take it easy. Just make us a counter. | <br/>
We want a two year... | Five year deal. | <br/>
Sandy, please. | <br/>
Twenty-four show minimum, | 50 grand an episode, | <br/>
with a 200K bump | every year we're on the air. | <br/>
This guy's an animal. | <br/>
He's literally foaming at the mouth. | <br/>
And the puppets get | their own dressing rooms. | <br/>
Just kidding. | <br/>
Okay. | <br/>
Three years, 20 show minimum, | at the numbers you mentioned. | <br/>
Deal. | <br/>
Ted, welcome to the UPN family. | <br/>
[gasping] | <br/>
And that's how Sandy died. | On the conference room floor at UPN. | <br/>
Just kidding. | They took him to the hospital. | <br/>
[machine beeping] | <br/>
Where am I? | <br/>
You had a minor heart attack. | A warning shot. | <br/>
Probably due to stress. And meat. | <br/>
Just need to rest for a few days. | Here you go. | <br/>
This is too nice of a room for me. | I can't afford this. | <br/>
Come on, man. I wasn't gonna let you | slum it down in the regular people ward. | <br/>
First class all the way for my Sandman. | <br/>
-You came! | -Of course. | <br/>
Miss Clarke, I love your new album. | <br/>
I play it every day. I'm obsessed with it. | <br/>
Thank you. | <br/>
-You're so beautiful. | -Thank you. | <br/>
-Can I touch you? | -[Sandy laughs] | <br/>
[nurse laughing] | <br/>
Oh, I... I... | I just touched the queen! [laughs] | <br/>
Oh, and you, sir, you need a new bedpan, | so I'm gonna grab that for you. | <br/>
-I used the bedpan while I was sleeping? | -Thanks. | <br/>
You did a new album? | <br/>
Oh. Don't you worry about that. | I want you to worry about getting better. | <br/>
It's scary, knowing your heart's not good. | <br/>
Sandy Wexler, you have | the biggest, best, strongest heart | <br/>
in this whole miserable town. | And that's a fact. | <br/>
Miserable town? | <br/>
It's been quite nice to you, | thank you very much. | <br/>
[scoffs] I guess. | <br/>
I just feel like I need a change, | you know? | <br/>
So I'm moving to Seattle. | <br/>
Seattle? What are you talking about? | <br/>
That whole grunge thing, that's old hat. | Why would you go there? | <br/>
The guy I'm marrying lives there. | <br/>
You're getting married? | <br/>
Yeah. | <br/>
Saturday, in Malibu. | <br/>
His name is Eric Lamonsoff. | He's not in show business. | <br/>
He owns a chain of coffee stores. | <br/>
A store that just sells coffee? | I don't know. | <br/>
That ain't gonna work, kid. | <br/>
I just need a... a break from the music. | <br/>
But singing's the only thing | that makes you happy. | <br/>
Yeah, but I'm looking for something else | to make me happy. | <br/>
'Cause that's not it anymore. | <br/>
Miss Clarke, I'm so sorry to bother you, | but would you? | <br/>
Sure. | <br/>
Is that the record? Can you play it? | <br/>
-Is there a player in the room? | -Yeah. | <br/>
I gotta hear this. | <br/>

Alfred? | <br/>
Wow. Nobody's called me that in years. | <br/>
Good to see you, Sandy. | <br/>
Hey, what are you doing here? | <br/>
Well, this is where | I get all my best ideas. | <br/>
Well, here and the radio. | <br/>
Yeah, you... you've been on such a roll. | <br/>
From "My Bologna" | to "Pretty Fly for a Rabbi." | <br/>
Just great. Clever stuff. | <br/>
Oh, thanks, man. Well, you know, | you're the one who put it all together. | <br/>
-[laughs] | -Remember what you told me? | <br/>
-Stick with the accordion. | -Uh-huh. | <br/>
Only wear Hawaiian shirts. | <br/>
Do funny words to other people's songs. | <br/>
-Genius. | -Huh? | <br/>
I'm glad. I'm glad it all worked out | for you. I really am. Sincerely. | <br/>
Thank you, man. Well, I'm just sorry | that we couldn't have done it together. | <br/>
Hey, listen. I got too close. | <br/>
Our friendship was getting | in the way of our business. | <br/>
You did what you had to do. | <br/>
Wait a minute. | Is that what you think happened? | <br/>
That is what happened. | <br/>
-You thought we got too close? | -Yeah. | <br/>
No, Sandy. | [stammers] That's not why I left you. | <br/>
I left you because you | could never tell me the truth. | <br/>
What? That's ridiculous! | <br/>
Tell me one time | I didn't tell you the truth. | <br/>
You told me we could copyright | the word "weird." | <br/>
No, I said it was weird | that we couldn't copyright it. | <br/>
You... Come on. You were hearing | what you want to hear. | <br/>
Sandy, you tell people | what you think they want to hear. | <br/>
-I don't agree. | -No, look. [stammers] | <br/>
For me, if you really care about someone, | you tell 'em the truth. | <br/>
You're right, Alfred. | <br/>
Damn it, you're 100% right. | <br/>
-Your hair looks good, by the way. | -Thanks, man, I... | <br/>
-You're lying again. | -I am. It looks like dirty spaghetti. | <br/>
I gotta stop. I'm gonna stop! | <br/>
-I'm gonna stop, Alfred. | -You should. | <br/>
Hey! Hey! You suck! | <br/>
You know what? | Real funny, Weird Al. | <br/>
Why don't you make me laugh one time | without using somebody else's music? | <br/>
Get off of me. | <br/>
[Sandy] I'd like to book a space | for a private event. | <br/>
No! No! Don't tell me it's impossible! | Everything's negotiable! | <br/>
Put it on your calendar, Ted. | Okay? Don't be late. | <br/>
I think we'll be busy. | <br/>
-I'm not talking to you. | -Hey! | <br/>
I'm talking to Ted! | <br/>
-Okay. We'll be there. | -What's his problem? | <br/>
I don't know. Just do what he says. | <br/>
[cheering] | <br/>
It's an international call, | so talk fast, okay? | <br/>
Can I count on you? | <br/>
Perfect. | <br/>
And you have a valid driver's license? | <br/>
How am I looking? | <br/>
You actually look good, Sandy. | <br/>
[yells] That surprises you? | <br/>
[knocking on door] | <br/>
-Courtney, your limo is here. | -It's showtime, girl. | <br/>
Wow. Um, it's early. | I'll be right down, guys. | <br/>
It's a big day, Miss Courtney Clarke. | <br/>
The biggest. | <br/>
-You look very beautiful. | -Thanks. | <br/>
How is traffic out there? | <br/>
Traffic's not a problem. | You sit back, relax. | <br/>
Let Firuz take good care of you. | <br/>
Sir, I think you missed our turn. | <br/>
No, no, no, no. | <br/>
That was a thing that on purpose I did. | <br/>
We're going shortcut. | <br/>
What are we doing here? | <br/>
Please, miss, go inside. | <br/>
I'm going inside to call the police. | <br/>
Sandy? | <br/>
Just you and me | under the stars again, kid. | <br/>
-Yeah, but now's not exactly a good time. | -I know. | <br/>
And I have no right to say to you what | I'm gonna say, but I'm gonna do it anyway. | <br/>
You like making trouble, | don't you, Sandy? | <br/>
Look, here's the thing. | <br/>
Maybe sometimes I got a way of telling | people what I think they want to hear, | <br/>
rather than what I'm really thinking. | <br/>
So I was thinking, if I started | saying the stuff that I think, | <br/>
maybe I'm gonna find out that's actually | what the people wanted to hear. | <br/>
Oh, shit, Sandy. | You mixed up your pills. | <br/>
What I'm trying to say is | this Eric Lamonsoff guy is wrong for you. | <br/>
Just like Bling was the wrong guy | and Lenny Kravitz. | <br/>
Marc Anthony. And Prince. | And Apollonia. | <br/>
Dennis Rodman, | who's great on the boards, but... | <br/>
You dated Dennis Rodman? | Good Lord. | <br/>
Dad, what are you doing here? | <br/>
Sandy's gettin' to that part. | You just listen. | <br/>
Yeah, thank you, Willy. | <br/>
All right, here's the deal. | <br/>
All those guys were chasing you | because you're incredible. | <br/>
But none of them really know who you are. | <br/>
Who am I, Sandy? | <br/>
You're Courtney Clarke. | <br/>
The beautiful swan from Magic Mountain. | <br/>
Now, I wouldn't tell you to break a deal | <br/>
unless I thought there was | a better offer out there for you. | <br/>
-Is there a better offer? | -Oh, absolutely. | <br/>
There's an aggressive offer out there. | <br/>
There's a guy who's willing to be devoted | to you 100% for your entire life. | <br/>
A guy who will make all the tough | phone calls, fight all the big fights. | <br/>
A guy who will never doubt you. | <br/>
Even when you doubt yourself. | <br/>
Keep going. | <br/>
He has surprisingly muscular quads | due to the ThighMaster. | <br/>
[Courtney chuckles] | <br/>
But what does this guy want in return? | <br/>
All he wants in return | is for you to be you, | <br/>
just the way you are, | because he loves you. | <br/>
I love you. | <br/>
I've always loved you. | <br/>
You're my star, Courtney. | <br/>
I love you, too, Sandy. | <br/>
I should have told you the truth | so long ago. | <br/>
Listen, I dye my hair. | <br/>
And I also apologize to my clothes | if I don't wear 'em enough. | <br/>
-No more truth. | -Absolutely. | <br/>
Just kiss me. | <br/>
Save that kiss. I came | all the way down here for a wedding. | <br/>
-Let's get to it. | -Yeah, let's not get him mad. | <br/>
Yeah, you're right. | <br/>
Boom Boom is ordained | as an interdenominational minister. | <br/>
Or we also have... | <br/>
[clears throat] Hey. Shalom. | <br/>
There he is. | <br/>
What do you say, kid? | <br/>
Will you marry me? | <br/>
You had me at "shalom." | <br/>
♪ I prefer you to remain a Christian ♪ | <br/>
No, no, no. That's fine. | Either way, I'm good. | <br/>
[Courtney laughs] | <br/>
["Things Are Looking Up" playing] | <br/>
Meanwhile, Eric Lamonsoff | was across town waiting at the altar. | <br/>
And don't feel sorry for him. | <br/>
That whole coffee thing | worked out just great. | <br/>
Plus, he ended up marrying | Downtown Julie Brown. | <br/>
-Honey? | -What? | <br/>
-You got a little schmutz, right there. | -Thank you. Thank you. | <br/>
Something had clicked with Sandy. | <br/>
And he started reaching out | one by one to his old clients. | <br/>
And because he started | telling them the truth... | <br/>
most of them ended up | having pretty big careers. | <br/>
-I signed with him. | -I signed with him. | <br/>
-I signed with him. | -We signed with him. | <br/>
And of course, I went back to Sandy. | <br/>
He's my manager and my best friend again. | <br/>
Too bad a wedding officiated | by a puppet was not legal. | <br/>
Which is why, 20 years later, | they're finally making it real. | <br/>
-[man] There he is! | -Yeah! How y'all doing? [laughs] | <br/>
[guests chatter excitedly] | <br/>
[indistinct chatter] | <br/>
Show business wealth is good, | but it's not real wealth. | <br/>
-It's not-- | -Hey, shot, man? | <br/>
-Let's do a shot? Oh, all right. | -I'm good. I'm good. | <br/>
-Hey! | -Oh, my God! Hi! | <br/>
[muttering indistinctly] | <br/>
I'm sorry, what? | <br/>
[continues muttering] | <br/>
I'm sorry, man. | I can't understand a word you're saying. | <br/>
No, seriously, I got nothing. | <br/>
All right. Hello. Hello. Hello. | Hi, guys. | <br/>
Oh, thank you, Sandy. | <br/>
All these years in the business, | he's got me working a wedding. | <br/>
This is fantastic. He booked me | in a tent, really is what it is. | <br/>
Said if I do good here, | I get a yurt next year. | <br/>
No, um... that was, uh, | some ceremony, too. | <br/>
It was a... It was a little awkward, | the priest and the rabbi together. | <br/>
That's always a... | <br/>
The rabbi, he was, like, Googling, | "Who's Jesus Christ?" | <br/>
But that's okay. | <br/>
Uh, what else is going on? | <br/>
-Just bring out the couple already. | -Yeah, quit doing your act. | <br/>
-You're right. Okay. | -[applause] | <br/>
Please welcome, for the first time ever, | Mr. and Mrs. Sandy and Courtney Wexler. | <br/>

Yeah, every time I ran into Sandy, he used | to say, "I got to meet this Beavis kid. | <br/>
Yeah, I want to represent him." | <br/>
He didn't understand | that that's a cartoon character. | <br/>
You can't really manage | a cartoon character. | <br/>
And, uh, he did give me his number though, | <br/>
and, uh, we used to call him | in the middle of the night. | <br/>
[phone ringing] | <br/>
[Sandy, groggy] Wexler Artists. | <br/>
[Beavis] Is this Sandy? | <br/>
Yeah. Yeah, who... who is this? | <br/>
[chuckles] You know who this is. | <br/>
No, I don't. That's why I'm asking. | <br/>
[chuckles] Guess. | <br/>
Are you Gary Busey? | <br/>
[chuckles] No way! Dumbass. | <br/>
[stammers] Who? Beavis? | <br/>
-You suck! | -What? No, I don't. | <br/>
You suck balls. | <br/>
No, no, no, no. | <br/>
You don't sound so good. | <br/>
Now, tell me where you are | and I'll pick you up. | <br/>
[stammers] I'm in your butt. | <br/>
What? What's this? | <br/>
Yeah, I'm in there right now. [chuckles] | <br/>
Hemorrhoids. | <br/>
Wait. You get out of my butt. | Get out right now. | <br/>
Kill yourself. | <br/>
Okay. Okay, that's it. | I'm hanging up the phone. | <br/>

[Butt-Head] Uh... Sandy Wexler? | <br/>
[Sandy] Who is this? | <br/>
[Butt-Head] Uh, this is Butt-Head. | [chuckling] | <br/>
[Sandy stammers] Oh, hi, Butt-Head. | <br/>
[Butt-Head] Uh, Sandy, | I'm calling about Beavis. | <br/>
[Sandy] Uh, yeah. Beavis wasn't | too courteous last night, Butt-Head. | <br/>
[Butt-Head] Uh, that's why I'm calling. | <br/>
[Sandy] Uh-huh. | <br/>
[Butt-Head] Uh, Beavis wanted | to say he's sorry. | <br/>
[Sandy] Oh, okay. He is, huh? | He... he's sorry? | <br/>
[Butt-Head] Yeah. Beavis says | he's sorry you're such a dumbass. | <br/>
[Sandy] What? What's that? | What? What'd you say? | <br/>
[Butt-Head] Uh, and he's also sorry | <br/>
that he said your face looks like a toilet | and your balls smell funny. | <br/>
